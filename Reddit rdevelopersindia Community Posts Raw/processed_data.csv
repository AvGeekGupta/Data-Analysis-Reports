"I am a 2023 graduate from DTU. I received a job offer through college placements. Initially, they informed us to start the job in June, but they delayed it to July, citing the need for training candidates. Despite this, they did not provide any financial support during the training period. Throughout the training, they conducted tests, evaluating our skills. The original date of joining was set for August 7th, but they kept postponing it, instructing us to perform well in the tests they administered. One such test required us to create a medium clone within 48 hours, with only basic Ruby knowledge provided in lectures. Somehow, most of us managed to complete the task. However, despite our efforts, they continued to postpone our joinings.

Finally, I received my joining date in September. Just one month after joining, they abruptly forced us to resign from our positions, stating that the company no longer required our services. They made this decision without evaluating the work we had done.

I am devastated and unsure about what to do next. I put in every effort to secure a decent placement, improving my DSA skills, solving 1000 LeetCode problems, and achieving the status of an expert on Codeforces, a 5-star rating on CodeChef, and a guardian on LeetCode. However, it seems that the market is inclined to hire experienced candidates.

"Hello everyone,

I wanted to share my recent interview experience with a startup where I applied for the role of Data Science Engineer. This post serves as a cautionary tale for job seekers.

I was initially connected with a hiring manager for interview scheduling and job role discussions. The first round was scheduled, but the interviewer never showed up despite me being on Google Meet 10 minutes before the scheduled time. This repeated for two weeks, and whenever I tried to contact the hiring manager to inform him, he was never available.

Finally, the first round happened with good feedback, and we proceeded to the second round. However, the same pattern continued for round 2. At one point, the interviewer abruptly ended the call during the interview without any explanation. Again, I had to contact the hiring manager to inquire about the situation, and he casually mentioned that they had an urgent meeting.

Surprisingly, I cleared the second round with positive feedback, and I was told they would schedule an HR round. That's when things took a turn for the worse.

After the second round, two weeks passed with no communication from them. They didn't respond to my calls, messages, or emails. I decided to delete their contacts as this level of unprofessionalism was unacceptable.

- Company Name: Zopper Ltd.
- Location: Noida
- Role Applied For: Data Science Engineer

I hope my experience can serve as a warning for others to be cautious when dealing with Zopper Ltd. during the interview process.

TL;DR: I had a highly unprofessional interview experience with Zopper Ltd. for the role of Data Science Engineer. The interviewer repeatedly missed scheduled interviews, and I was ghosted after the second round. Beware when dealing with this company.",Unprofessional Interview Experience,0.96,39,Interviews,True,2023-10-08 17:21:25,Data Engineer,PookieCooch,4,10,8,17,21,Sunday,41.0

I'm a tech lead with a team of around 10 qa + devs working in Chennai. I would like to work with their manager to get them lunch one of these days. They are hard workers and I'd like to personally thank them.

I'm paying out of my own pocket but I don't know the prices of things in India. I don't want to look ignorant on how I can achieve this so I'm looking for some help. Any would be much appreciated.

" Hello members! I am currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering, with plans to graduate in 2024. Placements have commenced, and I initially focused more on preparing for higher studies than for job placements. However, my plans have shifted, and I am now considering working for two years while studying for the GRE on the side. Many companies are visiting my campus, although not as many as last year. My main interests lie in Data Analytics and the field of ML, and I'm not particularly inclined towards software development.

Recently, I received an interview opportunity from a startup through a referral from my mom. They are in need of someone with AI/ML skills for their team. The HR informed me that I would need to work unpaid for 2 months, with compensation to be discussed based on performance (including a 6-month internship and the possibility of a full-time position). The role offers the flexibility of full-time remote work. The compensation discussed was 4 LPA, which is typical for freshers.

My question is, is a work-from-home job with a monthly stipend of 30k a good opportunity? I have materialistic aspirations and various things I'd like to acquire (a PC, mobile, bike, etc.). While campus placements are ongoing, most of the roles available are for software development, but I am applying to all opportunities (considering the challenging job market this year). The competition is fierce in my college, and I haven't prepared extensively for data structures. Should I seriously consider this work-from-home job or wait for more suitable placements? There are companies offering average CTCs ranging from 6 to 15 LPA. I am uncertain about passing an interview since my preparation hasn't been extensive, although I am currently studying concepts like OOPs, DBMS, and OS.

By the way, I am more comfortable coding in Python and not so proficient in C, C++, or Java. Some companies have coding tests specifically focused on C, C++, or Java, which I find challenging. The interview questions often revolve around these languages, which seems a bit unfair. I would greatly appreciate any advice on how to proceed.",Need Advice regarding my career,0.81,3,Career,True,2023-10-08 19:14:42,,HolidayInformal9567,5,10,8,19,14,Sunday,4.0
"A month back I was approached by HR from Gebbs for Sr Software Engineer role. Their tech stack was Python, MLOps, Anyone of frontend(React preferred).

There were 3 (technical rounds + HR round)

Round 1 was simple telephonic round about current work and few high level problems and how I will solve them

2 days later received call from HR from Round 2

Round 2 was moderately difficult, involved writing 2 programs (20 min for each) then technical questions, framework specific few questions follwed by devops and docker/kubernetes question - In total this round went almost 1 hour 30 minutes and I could solve both problems and overall I believe I could answer 75-80% question correctly and to best of my knowledge

Same day by evening I got call from HR for Round 3 which will happen with VP who is in US so I need to join this during US hours which I agreed and was scheduled next day itself

By this round I was positive that I will clear next round also so I decided to read more detailed reviews about company and work culture, I earlier check I could see overall rating was postive later I found that some formal employees have reported delays in salary, there is one video on youtube by formal employees were laid off (during pandemic) without any proper pay

This shattered my overall view about company still I decided to continue with round 3, it was 9PM IST interview and I was asked few basics, earlier projects and how soon I can join and at the end interviewer asked me if I have anything to ask so I asked him about this video on youtube and unpaid salary reviews. Interviewer was little shocked and with little angry voice started saying all these are fake things done by our competitor and immediately said thank you and disconnected the call without listening anything

I knew I will be rejected so I had no hope and I was happy thinking I dodged a bullet. I was waiting for some mail from HR but even after 2 weeks HR did not even bother to call or inform if I am selected or rejected.

"Last week, I applied for an entry-level Front-End Developer position at a startup company. The HR department contacted me and scheduled an interview for the following day. I attended the interview, and during the initial phase, the HR representative handed me an aptitude question paper and asked me to complete it within 15 minutes. After finishing the paper, I was told to wait for my technical round, which ended up being a one-hour wait.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, the HR called me into a cabin and handed me a phone with the Zoom app open, explaining that the CEO would conduct my technical interview remotely. I held the HR's phone and participated in the interview. Initially, the CEO's front camera was on, showing his home environment. However, he soon turned off his camera, and mine was activated. He proceeded to ask me questions related to front-end development, and I answered all of them to the best of my ability.

&amp;#x200B;

Towards the end of the interview, the CEO inquired if I had one year of experience. I honestly admitted that I had six months of internship experience. In a rather abrupt and impolite manner, he informed me that they were looking for a candidate with one year of experience. I tried to reassure him that I was capable of performing the role effectively and even offered to work as an intern without payment. Unfortunately, he rudely disconnected the call.

&amp;#x200B;

I shared my experience with the HR department, but they dismissed my concerns, claiming it was my problem. I am disappointed because I had to travel 30 kilometers for this job interview, which cost me money. Furthermore, it was frustrating to discover that the CEO was comfortably working from home, yet I was required to come to their office for the interview. What adds to the disappointment is that, despite answering all their questions correctly, I was rejected solely due to a lack of experience, which seems hypocritical given the circumstances.",I went for an interview and was disappointed with the CEO's behavior.,0.96,348,Interviews,True,2023-10-07 14:07:23,,Apprehensive_Bad8805,68,10,7,14,7,Saturday,362.0

"Hi there, LinkedIn users!

  
I've been working on boosting my LinkedIn engagement lately, and I think I've found a great way that can help people like me. Especially those who sometimes find it hard to come up with words or don't speak English as their first language. This can make it tough to comment or post on LinkedIn to grow your network and improve your professional image.

  
When ChatGPT came out, I spent a few days trying it out to see how it could help with the problems I face. One of those problems is finding the right words for comments or posts that can get people interested and make me look like an expert.

  
So, I started using ChatGPT to make this easier. It's like a secret that helps me save a lot of time on LinkedIn. I spend less time on there now and more time improving my strategy and content.

  
I did some research to figure out how to ask ChatGPT for help in a way that gets me the best prompts for my comments, posts, and messages. And after a few months, I've found some really good prompts to quickly connect with my network while sounding like an expert.

  
But even with all this, I still found myself switching between ChatGPT and LinkedIn, copying and pasting different content depending on what I needed. That's why I made a Google Chrome Extension that lets me create custom ChatGPT prompts that fit what I want and takes me straight to ChatGPT where I can generate infinite answers for free.

  
This has worked really well for me. It helps me start writing when I'm stuck and gives me a template that I can change to sound like me. And of course, it's way better than writing generic comments like ""This is great!""

  
So, to sum it up, here's what you should keep in mind when using ChatGPT for LinkedIn:\* Use it to write good comments.  
\* Make short posts.  
\* Ask questions to start conversations.  
\* Get messages and posts that fit your style.  
\* Check your writing to make sure it sounds right.  
\* Save time when reaching out to new people.  
\* Make content and profile views faster.

  
I've been focusing on these things, and they've really helped. I'm excited to share this way of doing things with you and see if it can help you too!

  
If you want to try my tool instead of doing everything by hand, you can find it here: [WiseReply](https://wisereply.framer.website/) . If you decide to give it a try, please reach out and I would be happy to give you some early user benefits. I'd be happy to help you get started and hear what you think.

**MySQL** is a widely used open-source relational database known for its performance, reliability, and scalability. It is suitable for various types of software applications, including web applications, e-commerce platforms, and content management systems.

The `PyMySQL` driver is used in this tutorial to connect to the **MySQL server** and create the MySQL database after connecting to the MySQL server by executing the raw SQL query.

The Flask app then defines the database connection URI string, and SQLAlchemy is initialized with the Flask app.

The **SQLAlchemy** is then used to create a table within the database in an object-oriented way using Python class. The backend is designed to handle database operations, while the frontend is designed to add data to the MySQL database and display it on the homepage.

"Hey fellow developers in India,

I recently attended a GDG (Google Developer Group) event in India, and I wanted to share my experience with you all. While the event had some fantastic content and comfortable seating arrangements, the overall management left a lot to be desired.

**The Good:**

* The content and discussions were insightful, and I had the chance to interact with some brilliant minds in the industry.

**The Bad:**

* The keynote speeches dragged on for an unnecessarily long time, and considering that many attendees, including students, had been standing for quite a while, this was a bit disappointing.

**The Ugly:**

* Chaos erupted when it was time to collect our swag bags before leaving. The crowd was unmanageable, and students were pushed around, creating a potentially dangerous situation.
* Queue formation was terrible, with no volunteers present to ensure an orderly line. This lack of organization could have led to a stampede or even more severe consequences.

To address these issues, a group of my college attendees and I have filed a formal complaint against the event and the organizing team. While the content was excellent, the poor management overshadowed the positive aspects of the event.

I hope that the GDG team takes our feedback seriously and works on improving their management skills for future events. We attend these events to learn, network, and grow as developers, and a safe and well-organized environment is crucial for a positive experience.

📷 **Problem**: When there's an issue on staging, our QA /Product/Support/OPs often tag entire channels/teams. This can be disruptive for some and the essential alerts can get lost for the ones they were intended for. Not to mention, manually checking each service to see if it's up is tedious.  

I looked around, and couldn't find any free/open-source small tool we could use, so made this. Big Organizations might already have a similar internal tool, but small teams/orgs with multiple microservices usually don't and that is where it's most helpful.

"Hi all. (Disclaimer: Long Post Ahead but need really honest opinions😶😶😶) I am a 2023 graduate and I have recently joined a company (from college placements) as a Data Scientist. Right now, all I have been working in is Tableau and SQL (90% SQL and analysis on that data) in the last 3 months. As a fresher I had always thought a Data Scientist to be working in Python and making models for most of the time but I haven't done any Python work as a part of the project.

1. Firstly, is that true?

2. Secondly, the company deals with data of different businesses (clients to be precise). I am worried if this is leading towards business roles and not data science. I have asked my manager about what are the future prospects in the project and he did say that there will be machine learning related stuff in a few months. He does also focus more on keeping probability and statistics concepts ready for application on the data. Assuming that I do gain experience in these things in a year, what kind of roles are open and in what kind of industries/companies? Is there some additional skills to add so I can get into those industries?

3. Lastly, I have had 3 internships (including a Summer Internship from college program...still regret not getting a PPO from that😓😓) and all have been towards ML/DL model making (title of all 3 internships were SDE intern and all have been product companies). Considering my current experience, will it be difficult for me to move back to SDE based roles? All I see on LinkedIn for SDE is a demand for experience in SDE based jobs previously which I definitely don't have (internships aren't considered).

"Hey Reddit community,

I wanted to share my recent experience working at an early stage startup. It's a story filled with ups and downs, but mostly downs, and I thought it might be helpful for others who are considering similar opportunities or dealing with difficult workplace situations.

I recently joined this startup, even though I had a better offer elsewhere, because it was a remote position. However, within a week, things started to take a turn for the worse. The founder, who was also my reporting manager, began to expect an unrealistic amount of work to be completed in a single day, with no proper knowledge transfer, code documentation, or feasible resources.

When I tried to explain the limitations of the libraries we were using and asked for guidance, I was met with disappointment and rude behavior. Seeking help from senior developers resulted in them labeling me as incompetent. It became clear that I was being isolated from the rest of the team and not allowed to take leaves, not even on public holidays that were made optional.

The situation escalated when the project timeline was shortened without warning, and I was berated for taking a previously approved leave. Eventually, they put me on a Performance Improvement and asked me to work for an additional 15 days, but at 50% of my already reduced salary.

The HR department, at first, seemed supportive but later revealed their true colors. During a final call with HR and the founder, I tried to negotiate for what I believed I deserved, but the founder abruptly told me to keep my code. Frustrated and disheartened, I ended the call, this now is used by HR to say I was behaving unprofessionally.

As of now, they still haven't paid me the remaining amount I'm owed, but I'm determined to move on from this experience. I wish I could name and shame the organization and its founder, who preaches professionalism and punctuality but behaves unprofessionally and is, in my opinion, questionable in their business practices.

This experience has taught me the importance of thorough research before joining any organization, especially startups, and the value of a supportive and respectful work environment.

"Let me explain the whole situation please,  


Around 7th September, I downloaded a wallpaper from a wallpaper site to use it as my background in my MacBook Air M1 but when I tried to open it, it showed me some kind of error which I don't remember correctly. On that evening I got worried that it might be a malware of some sorts so I installed and ran every kind of antivirus scan as possible but found nothing in the scans and I even did manual scanning as going through all the files and folders to check anything but found nothing suspicious.  
I asked the same question in multiple subreddits and discord servers but they all said that it will be fine and this doesn't generally happens but not 100% sure.   


That's why, I finally decided to get rid of this laptop to get out of this situation but again got scared because this laptop and my other devices are constantly connected to the same router and network and maybe the malware had hacked my router, infected it and is spreading the malware to other devices as well ( bunch of androids, ios devices etc.).   


All of my devices are constantly updated properly and don't install any unwanted apps such as apks from random site ( I only use play store ). I have some questions regarding this situation which are listed as follows :-  


1. Can the malware travel from my mac to my router, hacked it and spread the malware to my other connected devices?  
2. Can my android devices get malware without installing anything ( no 3rd party software ) ?  
3. Can an infected device spread the malware over wifi to any device easily without any restriction?  
4. Can a mac malware infected an android device.  


I'm planning to 1st change my wifi provider and then can my devices one by one to cut off any possible chance of infection.

"Hello everyone, hope all's good! :) First of all, thanks in advance for taking the time to read this post and provide suggestions. I believe context is key when asking for suggestions, so here goes a bit of background.

I graduated with a BCA degree in 2021, after which I spent 11 months working in Tech Support at a BPO, but I figured I didn't want to stay in the same sector. After leaving that job, I took a 4-month break, focusing on JavaScript concepts and starting with DSA in Python.

I then made the decision to join a startup as a web development intern, but I've realized that PHP (and its framework) aren't the languages I want to pursue. Two languages I really want to work in are Python and JavaScript, in that order. Now, as my internship is coming to an end, I'm unsure whether to join as a full-time employee.

I'd like to get some insights into my expectations. Is aiming for a 6-8 LPA job in Python and JavaScript unrealistic for my current situation? If it is, I'd really appreciate a roadmap to help me get there. If not, could you suggest companies or types of companies I should target? I'm even open to relocating if the it's the right opportunity.

Your suggestions would be really important. If any additional information is required, please feel free to ask. If this post serves its purpose, I may create another one seeking further related help.

Recently did a front end web dev internship focused on HTML CSS JS and ReactJS. Didn’t really like web dev, thinking of learning app dev with flutter using a Udemy course and a FreeCodeCamp course on yt. 

I do have one main concern, how is the job market for an app developer. I see a lot of people starting with web dev in my college, could definitely be because everyone’s doing it so they jump on the bandwagon. But I also see more jobs for web developers as compared to app developers. 

My main concern is, do companies look into what you did in college for on-campus placements? Will me doing app dev instead of web dev reduce my opportunities?

Campus placements have been bad in the recessions so might even have to go off campus, how is the scene there? Do companies care a lot about what you currently know/use?

After they contacted me on call. trying to lure me into their company's placement program which is 5k registration fees and if they failed to provide a 10.5lpa job, this amount is refundable
Then they send me the company's brochure, website link, course structure, and their previous alumni's linkedin profiles on WhatsApp.I told all this to my friend, he asked me to tell them to send all this on mail from their company's mail id and they even sent that mentioning all that they told on call.

I reached out to some of their alumni on LinkedIn asking them about the company and they all told well about the company.

1) none of their alumni's are in low or middle level companies. One was in apple, other in Netflix and one in nagarro.

Recently, I received an offer for my first internship as a Node.js developer in Bangalore. While I'm excited about this opportunity, the internship pays only 10,000 INR, and the cost of living in Bangalore is notoriously high. I'm aware that 10k is insufficient to cover my expenses in the city.

Here's where I need your advice and insights. Should I consider accepting this internship, even if it means dipping into my savings or seeking financial support from family to survive in Bangalore? My reasoning is that having some practical experience on my resume could open doors to better opportunities in the future.

Hey ,

I have been working as a intern in X company when I was hired I tried to find this company on LinkedIn couldn't find then I tried to search profile of my recruiter . I found the profile of the person apparently there was no mention of company X but there was current experience of company Y as a SDE which happens to be a startup. So I asked whereabouts of company X he replied its in early stages. I started to work we worked on company Y product and also out of sudden a new company comes out named Z which he says its his client. Apparently one day CEO of company Y calls me as i logged in to X product so he asked about if he could help I just told him that I work at company X as intern. He says his company has its software developers and no interns . My recruiter got to know that told me not pickup any calls from that number and not input my own number anywhere.

After some days , I worked on product of company Z which also has its owns developer and doesnt out source tech work. So i asked one of its developer which was intern in company Z about my recruiter whereabouts in that company. He told he is a developer in team. and recruiter got to know it and gave me a warning if you have curiosity about company ask me else its a violation of contract and warned me about legal consequences. and also I worked on other products for company A, B also

Also this company gave me no holidays for festives even asked me to work on national holidays. and asks me to do overtime because I couldnt finish my work due to no designs of ui , no system design , no database schemas .

"So I joined this company 3 months ago. When I was being hired they told me that they will try to keep my job as remote as possible(current location - ghaziabad). After I was onboarded I gave interviews and cracked a gurgaon based company. It was told to me that you just need to go for deliverables or twice a week. Then I was told by client to come atleast thrice a week. I then negotiated with the client for twice a week. After that the work started, most of it was pretty straight forward and required copy-pasting. Then my reporting manager left and I worked from home only. They then paired me up with very dull person who was not giving KT properly and was very occupied. Then after a heated discussion with the Head and CEO I was negotiated to work 2-days a week. I started going there. There was not much work between that period and the same continued. On Thursday my HR gave me a call and said that your performance is below average and why are you not going to office 3-times/week and that we are putting you on a notice period.

"Hey all chair owners and experts. I need some help choosing my ergonomic chair. After all the recommendations, today I visited the featherlite showroom in my city. As said in this sub, the two chairs that stood out to me was liberate HB(\~rs.16500) and helix(\~rs. 25500).  

Liberate HB: It was actually designed by featherlite. The chair was very comfortable. The dynaflex system is indeed very helpful in maintaining posture. The back support also bends, adapting to out body motion, with which I am surprised with. The things that I disliked was the mesh in the back was very rough and felt a little uncomfortable. Only 1d armrest.  

Helix: This chair is a korean import as said by the sales guy. Initial impression, it was very comfortable, a bit more than the liberate, cushion is soft, notably the mesh was of very high quality and superior to liberate. I don't know how to exactly specify on what part I felt comfortable, but overall the chair was more comfortable than the liberate, but not by a huge margin. The things I disliked were the headrest and back support. At this price point, the headrest is not adjustable. The backrest works, but its too basic and unadjustable.  
These were my initial impression. Currently, the sale is going on, on amazon. I can get the liberate for 14k and the helix for 24k after all offers. Is it justifed to pay 10k more for the helix?  

Also I was also looking for the sihoo doro c300 on amazon, after all offers it costs around 27500rs. It looks way superior to its competitors on paper with dynamic lumbar support and other fancy tech. But I am skeptical about after sales and customer services and most importantly its durabilty and relianility. The reviews that I came across on amazon US and youtube looked like almost everyone of them were paid ones.

"I have more than 9 YOE and currently working as a Lead Developer. I am up for promotion in Jan and I have option to either choose the Managerial path or Architect path. I am good at the developer side and average on the managerial stuff, personally I think I want to stay in the individual contributor role.

BUT... I don't want to risk my financial freedom, growth, job security and stability. Due to lot of uncertainty in IT I would prefer to choose the path which doesn't block doors for me.

I could be wrong but my understanding is Manager with Dev background get better opportunities/openings than Architects. As Manager profile has very generic topics and low bar to get hired in comparison to Architects where expectations are very high and its very specialized, which means your profile should match a lot with the job opening's team requirement/tech stack. Which is very difficult and bring down the already fewer openings to even lower.

3. **Regulate Dubious IT Practices**: Implement stringent policies against fake call centers and consultancies that offer fake experience letters. I feel governments have not focused much on these as these might offer some employment opportunities, but they are hurting the reputation of Indian IT and might come back to bite the genuine employees.
4. **Income Tax Slab rate Revisions**: Reevaluate income tax slabs by considering inflation and the cost of living. Although this falls under the central government's jurisdiction, I think we should start this dialogue with local lawmakers and be urge them to come up with their party stand and further discuss this in upcoming parliament elections.

I have a little less than 2.5 years of experience in this field and I haven't felt this exhausted ever.

I personally work around 15 hours a day so that I can try and complete the feature in the 2-3 days window, and this is not a one time thing, this has been happening literally every sprint.

2) do I change my approach to learn fully then start building? Which might take another 6 months of grind before I write my first LOC (and not sure if I am up for that sorta commitment.)
3) or do I continue with my current way of development as this is the way how development is learnt (my only concern with this is high reliability on ChatGPT4, but as the code grows, it will get harder for me to debug n shiit).

"I was working at this company as a Software Engineer for last 16 months and it was my first job. The money wasn't bad too (around 11-12 LPA in hand, got one small hike since joining). 

Reasons I quit the job -
1. Hated it, it didn't start that bad but since last 3 months my hate has grown a lot for my job. Always been waiting for Fridays, absolutely no motivation to complete tickets on time. Also was getting very intimidated everytime Manager called for a meeting, my performance had gone really down. 
2. Not getting any time to work my side projects. Ever since I joined this company, I have done zero side projects. I just don't have enough energy to do them after tiring days of work. 
3. I don't think I'm learning a lot in this company. I've been given just same techstack again and again for last 16 months, I've asked for some UI work as well a few times from my manager, CTO but they always called me out on my performance instead. 
4. My long term goal is to be self employed developer, so I want to fail now when I'm young (I'm 22 now, I can't afford to not take any risks now and regret in future)

My plan of action -
1. I will make 6-7 side projects I have in mind and deploy them to Google play store in next 2 months (when I'm in notice period)
2. I will write atleast one technical paper in one of the techstacks I was working in this company which I really liked. 

I also believe that completing above 2 tasks will also help in getting another job (If nothing works out) since it'll improve my resume a lot. My long term goal is to make a lot more money than I'm doing currently, not 2X or 3X, but 20X more money and that can only be done if I become really skilled and give myself enough time to try and fail.

"Hello! fellow devs,

**Is  Gate worth it? or should I just stick to the Job hunting grind?**

Currently doing MCA (distance).

I \[23M\] work at a very small company in Gurugram (11 people in India team &amp;&amp; 2 something in the US on a different domain than ours).  Currently, I am working on a project as a contractor for Infosys on a project with Motorola as our client.

CTC - 6 LPA

After graduation (BCA from a tier-3 college/ only mass recruiters show up for placement). I started preparing for the JAM examination but due to personal circumstances, I took a job at my current company.  I joined here as a front-end dev (React JS) but now for the Motorola project, I have also written many API routes on Motorola's existing system in .NET and used SQL server to create and manage DBs.

My friend kinda convinced me to prepare for the GATE CSE examination, as he is already preparing (he quit his job at Deloitte for the preparation).

I am very **VERY** confused. As I like working and development stuff. I want to switch to a new Job.

But, It is also true that the market is very down.

The opportunities that the GATE examination opens are very exciting as well. MTech from a Tier 1 institute, top quality education, great exposure, placements and all of that.

But I am afraid if I fail to clear the exam.

If I choose to prepare it will take the whole of 2024. My friend makes a case that even if I don't like preparing, whatever I would have learned at that point, will help me crack a job interview.

At one moment, I get excited about the gate examination, at another moment I get excited about a new Job and afraid of the Gate examination.

"I'm an sre/dev on with over 3.5 years of experience. I was working on same tech stack for past 3.2 years. 

About 3 months back, all of a sudden I was thrown into a new tech stack. I had no knowledge about it. Had to begin from bottom and I was expected to deliver every sprint. What can I say, I started my career at WITCH.

About 1.5 months into project and I was paired up with 1 other dev who was expert in the tech stack. Somehow, me the experienced dev gave me all manual work and she used to do the actual dev work.

She would give me work and she would go talk with seniors about the requirement. I wasn't informed about various things. She was a little rude too. I would just complete work and send back to her.

Since she was taking care of things other than manual and annoying work, I didn't get much implementation work. I was assigned a new task and I needed her help to finish it.

1 day before submission, she tells in status call that I know everything and she won't be available to help as she's on leave. She threw me under the bus. I was shocked. She even shouted saying it's simple while it wasn't and there were soo many things to do.

Now, I have done how much ever I could do. I have decided to update in status call that I needed her assistance to complete. There is soo much pressure to deliver build by tomorrow evening. I had to vent it.

"Front-end developer, 4yrs exp. I've been on notice period for 3 weeks (WITCH). I was on bench only before so HR asked me to resign and cut the notice period short from 3 months to 4 weeks. After resigning I got in touch with a couple of folks in higher positions (ex managers with whom I have a good relationship) within the company to see if I can get any project allocation. Nothing for 3 weeks.

Even though I had not started preparing or applying for interviews outside, I was kinda okay with it, as I have decent amount of savings and don't have any large financial commitments. Also due to some issues in personal life, I was looking forward to taking a little break and mentally prepared myself for taking a short vacation (booked a trip even) and then the whole process of being jobless, upskilling and interviews and all. 

Fast forward to my second last working day I get a call for a project in a completely new technology, something not exactly related to my field of interest. They said so and so person (one of my ex manager) reached out to us and on basis of his recommendation we are willing to onboard you and train you on the new tech stack. Since there wasn't a lot of time left I had to make the decision immediately and withdraw  my resignation, which I did eventually even before I had some time to properly think things through.

Since it's not exactly UI development, I'm not sure what to make of this. Is staying back the right call? Or should I still go ahead and quit, take some time off to upskill in React and MERN probably and then look for job somewhere else?

"I recently stumbled upon Github's dmca repo, where they document all the dmca (copyright infringement) notices received by them.

I was suprised to find that the company that has sent by far the most DMCA takedown notices on Github is – Nykaa! They've made more than 130 DMCA requests in the last two years. 

Why is Nykaa, of all places, sending so many takedown notices on Github? Thanks to Github making the content of dmca notices public, I scrolled through some of the repos that received notices from Nykaa.

Turns out, as part of a coding assignment for an online fullstack development course offered by a Bangalore based ed-tech firm, their students have to build a clone of Nykaa frontend and push the code to Github. Dozens of students build and publish these assignments regularly on Github.

Nykaa, for reasons only they can explain, deem these demo projects to be dmca-takedown-notice-worthy. So every month Nykaa sends dozens of takedown notices to every student-made assignment of Nykaa's frontend on Github.

&amp;#x200B;

Github has a well-documented dmca policy page with guidelines on fair use considerations for dmca notices. Going as far as asking to state in the notice if Fair use has been taken into consideration.

Surely all these repos fall under fair use protection? I don’t understand the small-mindedness of Nykaa in sending notices for such trivial things.

&amp;#x200B;

And Nykaa is not the only Indian company doing this. Amongst others, Paytm is not too far behind with 60+ dmca requests and Meesho with 40+ for very similar takedown reasons. As per the dmca data on Github, the same third-party agency handles all the dmca notices for these 3 companies (plus a few more Indian companies)

It is very common to make clones of well-known websites for frontend development courses and job interviews. (Search Github for ""instagram clone"" or ""youtube clone"")

I don't understand why Nykaa is so petty?

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I published a copy of this post on my newsletter and Github under a repo named ""NYKAA CLONE"", I hope this will bring their attention to this post by triggering some dmca alarm somewhere in their system.

In meetings I’ve tried to listen to people but I get headaches so I skip meetings just get input from PRD and develop. In case of clarity I personally connect with the teammate they explain in English.

Currently doing average at work, no complaints from Team, I work in the allotted time and work on myself during free time

TLDR; As I’m working + upskilling I don’t have much time/people’s help to learn Hindi. need an efficient way

PS: I don’t care about linguistic politics, I’m trying to make myself better and wanna learn Hindi to chat with coworkers/friends, watch Bollywood, not get scammed in North India, work may get easier and why not!

Feeling completely overwhelmed in my final year of computer engineering. I've dipped my toes into various things, gained some knowledge here and there, and even chipped in on a few open-source projects. However, I'm still grappling with breaking into those coveted, well-paying open-source programs.

I'm fascinated by the world of open source, and it's disheartening to see people less skilled than me, or who started alongside me, landing fantastic opportunities.

"bit of background, I am a robotics engineer, I recently left my old job in search of a new one, and I have 2 years of experience in this field.

I was recently selected for a startup. The first round was easy it was with the CTO who is a 4th-year B-Tech student, they told me to build a robot arm in CAD and different designs in 4 days, at this point they said I was selected as I was aligning with company goals just one more round. The next round was with the CEO/Founder he wanted me to come to the location for a vibe check (not my words he actually said ""I wanted to know my vibe"") I packed my bags and went because as the CTO said I was selected there we had a chat for 2.5 hours, he also said you are the right person we need then he said ""You have to join on 3 Oct,"" I said ""Yes"" but due to some personal reasons I had to postpone to 5th I said that to the CEO on 1 OCT he was cool with it but suddenly I was called for an interview on 2 OCT this was some other guy for that company he asked I bit about robotics and a lot of off-topic questions and I was not able to answer few it was related to design it's been a long time since a read about design and that was not my job too. and everyone who was taking the interview knew nothing about Robotics CEO just opened a Textbook in front of me and asked me questions from it. and one more thing during this whole process I was asking about the pay range or details about the offer letter every time they were extending dates like tomorrow you will get like that and on the final day of 3 OCT they sent me an email saying you are not selected because you do not align with our goals IDK what happened suddenly before I was the perfect candidate and then I was nothing.

so what I learned from this experience was

1 - do not trust a company who does not know about the job they are hiring for

2 - it just took 6 months for a 4-year B-Tech guy to become an Intern to CTO

3 - do not trust a CEO who quotes Elon Musk

\- Apply on the LinkedIn Jobs listing (especially to jobs that offer relocation support I sometimes even mention to companies that I can handle the VISA processing myself but relocation support is something that I would require)

\- Reach out to potential recruiters letting them know of my interest in the role that I have applied (some of them reply stating they had to move on with other candidates but most of them don't see my message at all or ghost me)

\- I also reach out to employees to learn more about the company from them and then try to see if I can get a referral through them (haven't done this a lot yet but need to try)

"For me , its Java more specifically  people working on most stuff built by Oracle , 80% of the people I know who work in Java/Oracle based stacks are really arrogant and have this superiority complex i only see in Arch Linux users.

"I don't know if it's the right sub for this post but i would love to get some opinions since I'm very anxious now a days.
I am from ece department from a tier 2 college. But since past year I was learning DSA, Mern stack and SQL to get software placement since  that is what everyone was doing. But this year placement scenario was very different due to recession and very few companies visited our campus. Most of the software profiles were open only for cse and IT departments. 

So i applied for a Graduate trainee profile in a automotive company and got the offer. The compensation is good enough for a start. But they haven't told us anything about the profile or department we will be assigned during the training. It can be anywhere from production to design to operations and even supply chain. It makes me worried because i don't want to stay in the automotive industry for long. I am planning to switch after 1-2 years in IT industry. I just applied to this company because already very few companies are coming to campus and I was scared. And now I am blocked from applying to any other company.

So my question is, if anyone has worked in a similar profile in a similar industry, how difficult is it to switch to a different profile like software Developer or embedded systems developer (most of my personal projects are mern stack but I'm learning about embedded systems now) etc after a year ? I'm worried if I'll be given a totally different department like supply chain management then I won't be considered for interviews etc in the future.

It might have been okay if it was an occasional thing or if he was working on something time sensitive, but thats not the case. 

Now because of this he get praised alot &amp; US people are always thanking him and it is making us look bad because even if I finish my tickets before expected date, I refuse to take any meetings, calls or reply to anyone after 8PM. 

I have tried to communicate with him by casually asking about his working hours, he laughed &amp; said he is always working &amp; dont have any fixed hours.

"Hello guys,

I graduated with a degree in Computer Science few months ago. Ever since I graduated, I have felt very very under confident  and under equipped for the job market, especially with it being so competitive. I've always been a decent student, but I never actually tried to learn a programming language expertly. Know a bit of everything and did what was needed for the course and a couple of projects - mostly ML related since it was interesting . Spent most of free time, especially during COVID, doing nothing useful, like playing games and stuff. Looking back on it, I feel and I know that was a big mistake and now I'm behind the curve.  I started looking at all these ""Data Science/Analytics"" hype videos and fell for it and decided that it would be better if I go abroad and properly learn, but it's sooo costly that's it doesn't really make sense for me now to put my parents through that burden. I was preparing and applying to foreign universities last couple of months, but now I'm rethinking. 

Seeing all the posts of the big bros here making 8-10 LPA and some even twice or higher that amount inspires me. I want to change my life and give my parents the life they deserve. They have worked extremely hard to educate and it's high time to start repaying them.

"I was placed in A IT company through College Placement, I got very good offer letter as Fresher.

They offered me 6 months internship with no stipend, but after that if I get selected I will get -- LPA.

After 6 months &amp; 3 rounds of interviews, many KT(Knowledge Transfer) rounds, they got me selected.

They played a trick here and didn't disclose their Placement % but I figured out somehow that it is slightly more than 50%.

But didn't bothered me as I was selected &amp; happy.

Was told will be given offer letter with joining date soon, might be a little late.

I was still happy because I thought 1-2 months are okay.

But I saw one of my friend (found out nearly 15 people) was told that they will have late joining after 6 months (Jan 2024) which they were angry and started meetings with HR but as result no answer. They were given option to leave if they don't want to wait.

I got offer letter of November 2023 which is 3 months later, I was not okay, but still managed and thought okay will wait till than.

After around 20 days we got call &amp; were said that we will also be joining in January 2024, last offer letter is terminated &amp; we got new one.

After we talked to HR told us that she will give us surity mail that they will hire us Last by Jan no further delaying. 

But we rather received a mail where it was acknowledgement that they have extended date of joining, &amp; we can leave if we don't want to wait.

Also texting HR in groups but they aren't replying.

Also company hired few in September &amp; few in Octomber,
As they are saying that they will hire everyone but will take some time.

"And I am back.

As a freelancer/contractor, it is likely that you receive reimbursements for certain expenses from clients.

These reimbursements can be for necessary operating expenses like software and hardware costs or they can be reimbursements for client specific requests like travel costs for making on-site visits every year.

It is important to understand the taxability of the same and whether the same have to be added to your turnover as declaring the turnover incorrectly can lead to stripping away of 44ADA/44AD( the schemes that allow you to pay taxes on only 50%/6% of your revenue), which can lead to huge tax payments and penalties.

Tl;dr: The reimbursements will be added to you turnover and you have to consider them as Income for payment of taxes.


The reason for that is the way value of supply is defined under GST. For context, the value of supply is the __“price”__ that your buyer pays you for the transaction. When the value of supply for all such transactions is added together, for one year, the value that arrives is called turnover for that year.

As per the GST act, the following shall be the value of supply:
1.	The price paid by the buyer, if price was the sole consideration.
However, it shall also include:
2.	Any taxes and charges collected separately by the supplier( unless it is under the GST act).
3.	Any amount that supplier was required to pay, but is actually paid by the recipient of the services.
4.	Incidental expenses incurred by the supplier and charged separately for, by the supplier. DOES NOT HAVE TO BE AT THE TIME OF SUPPLY OF SERVICES.

On a plain reading, the reimbursements could fall under point 3 or 4. Hence, they must be included in the turnover you report for the purpose of GST and Income tax. Another thing to note here is that even if the client incurs the expense on your behalf,  the same will STILL be covered by point 3 and you will have to include that in your turnover. The only thing you gain by doing that is that you have now complicated your taxation.

Lastly, and this is not related to taxation, in the world of business, the price factors in for everything. And you already factor in things, without actively thinking about it.

Consider a situation where a new client wants you to visit them onsite every year, that will cost you Rs. 5 lakhs in terms of of additional costs. For quoting that client, your rate would be higher than your normal rates by atleast so much of amount that atleast the additional outflow of Rs. 5 lakhs is covered. 

And the Income tax and GST operate from the similar frame.
PS: A good workaround is to have  the billing to be in name of client(as far as possible), while the ship to address(for physical products) should be yours.

" I'm looking for a monitor that meets the following criteria:

* USB-C or Thunderbolt connectivity
* 1440p resolution (not a hard constraint)
* Refresh rate greater than 144hz (mandatory)
* Budget under 40k INR (preferably under 30k INR)

I want to connect my office laptop and gaming laptop to the same display, and I would like to be able to use the same gaming mouse and keyboard on both laptops by just switching the input on the monitor.

**Laptop details:**

* Office laptop: Dell Latitude 5430 Laptop with i5-1145G7 vPro, Integrated Intel Iris Xe Graphics, Thunderbolt. Laptop charges via USB-C PD (65W).
* Gaming laptop: Lenovo Ideapad Gaming 3 with (AMD Ryzen 5 5600H/8GB/512GB SSD/4GB NVIDIA GTX 1650/120Hz). It has a USB-C port, but not Thunderbolt. I believe that this USB-C port will only output from integrated AMD graphics at 60hz and not from GTX1650.

**Questions:**

* Is it possible to use the same gaming mouse and keyboard on both laptops by just switching the input on the monitor?
* If so, what features should I look for in a monitor to support this?
* Can you recommend any specific monitors that meet all of my criteria?

Thank you for your help!

**Use case:**

* Office: Heavy Google Sheet usage, extremely large spreadsheets, PowerBI dashboards, SQL, and Python (Analytics)
* Gaming: Mainly esports titles, with occasional playtime in singleplayer/coop

**I would appreciate any suggestions for monitors that meet my requirements. I am also interested in hearing from anyone who has experience using a single monitor with multiple laptops, and whether or not they are able to use the same gaming mouse and keyboard on both laptops.**

**Additional notes:**

* I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit if there are any really great options just beyond the 40k INR mark.
* I'm also interested in any other features that would make my setup more hassle-free, such as KVM switching or power delivery.
* Or any potential pitfalls that I should avoid.

Thank you again!

"Please don't misinterpret my post title.. all I want to ask is, ""How to maximise my package when I graduate""

Hi guys,

I'm student in my second year pursuing computer science engineering. I have 2 more years until graduations and have been doing great so far for my resume. I only did coding until the end of my first year, learned web development in my second year, got an internship for 3 months during which I was paid.

My end goal is to get a really high package, I'm in a tier 3 college. Should I focus on web development (learn more frameworks), or should I focus on only data structures, algorithms (leetcode grind) for the next year and start applying for jobs? I can't do both because I also have to manage college and health, but am willing to put in all the necessary effort for the goal of achieving this high package.

I have 2 more years and don't want my learning curve to stagnate over the course. I love programming and want to pursue a career in this field, but I don't want all my effort to lead me to an average package that a tier 3 student gets.

I joined this college because it was convenient to travel to, thinking that I could focus on coding and programming in my house (miss classes and study), and have been doing that. I just want to feeling satisfied when I get placed in the future, and feel like I made the right decision. (I could've gone to a better college but that college would've also been tier 3, so it wouldn't make a big difference. Hence I chose convenience over a slightly better college)

It feels like I've come a long way in these 2 years, but am also slightly panicked about the fact that I'm 50% of the way there. 2 more years and I will be getting placed, I just want to be happy then. That's all I want. ",Next steps for a high package (atleast 20 lpa),0.38,0,College Placements,True,2023-10-05 20:31:58,,Obvious_Bit_4812,6,10,5,20,31,Thursday,0.0

"Hello everyone,

I'm 27 years old and work as a data scientist in Bangalore, making 27 lakhs per year. I have 4.5 years of experience and have worked on different projects like Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

I'm excited about going to the USA for a master's degree, not just for the education but also to explore a new lifestyle and travel before I get older. I've lived in Bangalore my whole life, so living in another country seems like a great adventure.

But, I'm worried about the job market and the economy. I'm thinking about applying for master's programs starting in Fall 2024, either in Data Science or Information Technology and Management. My academic background includes a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering with a GPA of 2.6/4, and I also have a PG diploma in AI with a GPA of 3.4/4. I scored 7 in the IELTS exam, and I have worked on many projects in my job, although I haven't written any research papers. I am dependent on loans for Masters

I want to know if going to the USA for studies is a good idea given the current job market. Or should I wait? I feel like I'm getting older at 27. If I decide to go, I'm also curious about which colleges I can apply to.

"**Update: Exciting News – I'm Moving to Europe!**

[Taking Bet On My Career](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/16c73yi/taking_a_bet_on_my_career/)

Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to share some exciting news with you all – I've accepted a job offer in Europe ! Many of you have been asking about how I managed to secure this opportunity, **As promised**  I thought I'd give you a quick rundown. But before I dive into the details, here are a few key points to keep in mind:

&amp;#x200B;

**Job Hunt Abroad Can Be Challenging**: Searching for a job abroad can be quite a daunting and time-consuming process. The competition is fierce, and rejection rates are high due to the sheer number of applicants. Also, be prepared to communicate with non-English speaking expats in European countries. While we Indians generally have a great accent and command of English, sometimes interviewers may struggle to understand us.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now, let's get into how I made it happen:**

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Crafting the Perfect CV:**

\- The first step to getting noticed by any company is to beat their Applicant Tracking System (ATS). This often requires fine-tuning your CV.

\- I spent countless hours perfecting my CV, experimenting with different formats, and customizing it for each application.

\- Be ready to fill out lengthy forms and answer questions about your motivation to join the company. You can't use a one-size-fits-all CV, motivation letter, or cover letter. Each job application demands tailored materials.

\- Many candidates drop out because of the time-consuming ATS process.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Dealing with Rejections:**

\- Be mentally prepared for rejection, especially when you're up against thousands of other applicants.

\- Companies typically prefer local candidates unless they can't find the right skills locally. Your chances of being hired are often less than 1%.

\- Think of it as a filtering process where each interview round is like a knockout stage.

\- I've been rejected for various reasons, including being overqualified for a position, not showing the required leadership skills, or not aligning with a company's diversification goals.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. The Power of Networking:**

\- Networking is key. Focus on connecting with people who have a specific target market in mind.

\- To improve my networking game, I automated my LinkedIn outreach (note: I did this within legal limits) to find prospects. Be cautious about LinkedIn scraping to avoid getting your account blocked.

\- I managed to secure two interviews through networking, including one where I referred someone from my previous organization, and they later returned the favor.

\- I also reached out to an ex-HR contact, which led to an introduction to a company HR for a role I was interested in. Having a clear target and networking helped me achieve a 100% success rate in these cases.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Building Personal Connections:**

\- Regardless of the outcome of interviews, focus on creating personal connections.

\- In the past, I've interacted with multiple organizations and got rejected, but I maintained connections with HR and interviewers via LinkedIn.

\- This personal touch led to multiple interview requests from those contacts. It great to see when these people reach out to you how's your son/daughter is doing over Linkedin. So keeping a close connection with people help you a lot

"As the title suggests, I find myself in a complete dilemma. I recently completed my B.tech CSE in 2023 with a decent CGPA of 7.5 from a private college. I secured a campus placement in a company with a package of around 5 LPA. Location will be bengaluru or pune ig. However, the company's onboarding process is taking much longer than expected, and I haven't been onboarded yet. Maybe it will be done by this year or by feb 2024. The company sends regular updates so I think the onboarding will be done for sure.

In the meantime, due to the company's delays, I applied and got accepted into an M.Tech CSE at a state government college which is located nearby my house. Also, as far as placement is concerned I don't think they will be having many companies coming there but decent amount will be there. Now, my question is, considering the experienced individuals in this subreddit, what would you all recommend I do? 

Also, I originally planned to discontinue my studies after completing my B.Tech, but the delayed onboarding prompted me to apply for the M.Tech program.","Complete dilemma, What to do?",0.89,26,Suggestions,True,2023-10-04 10:50:23,,LibrarianTiny5,25,10,4,10,50,Wednesday,29.0
"Long post ahead.

Ater joining accenture in feb 2022 and completing my initial training, I was assigned to a support project with no scope of learning. I was working on customer tickets in production environment and did some monitoring work. I hated this work and badly want to move to actual development.

But in this august 2023, I was moved out from my team, for a new support team for a production instance of another market in our project itself. Remember this production instance is still in development stage and no there are no tickets to work for me.

Initially I was assigned some testing tasks in the new dev and testing environment. After few weeks no one assigned any tasks to me. So I tried to utilize this time and concentrated on upskilling. So haven't attended the daily dev status call also. Also no one asked me to attend. Remember I was moved for new market's support team. Not the dev one. Its been two months and I heard that it will take another 2-3 months for the production to come to live. 

Also I asked for release from the project to my previous team lead, who is currently my supervisor. She told that release is not possible since I was still an ASE and haven't got promotion. She told that release is possible only after the first promotion for freshers as per company policy. It will take another 6-8 months for me to get promotion.

Another person who was also moved for new production support team volunteered himself to do testing tasks for the dev team. He is now insisting me to ask the dev lead to give me tasks or else I will be in trouble.

A small note about the dev team: they are using a low code tool for product development and I have zero interest in learning it.

I learned basics of web dev(react js) and planning to get into development either by switching company or internally.
 
Now what should I do? Should I don't care about the low code development work and continue upskilling? 

Will I get any trouble for doing so in future?

Another option for me is giving resignation and search for another job in web dev role. Notice period will be 3 months. But conidering the current market it will be a huge risk.

I am currently in WFH like most of the people in my team.

I had travel plans last weekend, but unfortunately, health issues got in the way. Since I couldn't leave the house, I decided to learn something new. As a backend engineer, I thought it would be interesting to explore the frontend world, so started learning Next.js.

I ended up creating a minimalist coding resource site called [100daysofcode.io](https://www.100daysofcode.io). The idea behind it is to provide a clear path with valuable resources for anyone starting their programming journey in any language. I've kept the website as minimal as possible.

What do you think of the site? Are there any features or resources you'd like to see added in the future? Thanks in advance for your feedback! 😊

"Hi guys

Wanted to share with you all an AI-based interview practice tool that we've developed - [Trupeer.ai](https://Trupeer.ai). We noticed a lot of gaps in the interview prep journey in our circles - especially in coding interviews. While there are coding test platforms like Leetcode, there is no solution that simulates an end-to-end coding interview experience, including all the questioning, follow-ups, thinking on the spot, communication skills, etc.

[Trupeer.ai](https://Trupeer.ai) solves this problem by offering real back-and-forth conversations with an AI interviewer. For example in DSA, the AI interviewer first asks you for a brute force solution, followed by an optimization discussion, and then a cod. The questions are also tailored to the role and interview type, so you get a full breadth of interview experience - you can practice anything like DSA, System Design, Technical interview, Behavioural interview, etc.

At the end of every interview, you get skill level scores and specific feedback on how you can improve your answers and communication skills. 

Do check it out and let us know your feedback. The first trial is completely free.

Cheers!

"The answer to the title may seem obvious to a lot of people, but there is a sizeable section of the population that is confused if they are salaried or contractor.

This is especially true when overseas employers are involved and the contract is for fixed monthly payments and/or the contract allows you similar terms as you would get in job.

It is also important to briefly discuss why this discussion is necessary. Being a contractors(and having gross receipts of Rs. 75 lakhs or less, typically) means you can declare 50% of your gross receipts as expenses. In other words, you only pay taxes on 50% of your revenue from the engagement. Of course, this is important.

###Here are a few ways to determine the same for individuals working for Indian clients/employers:

1.	You should look at your 26AS to see the section under which your TDS is being deducted. If the section is not 192 or 192A, it means you are not a salaried employee for your client. Typically, the TDS for freelancers/contractors is deducted under section 194J or 194C. THIS IS THE MOST RELIABLE WAY TO DETERMINE THE EMPLOYMENT STATUS.
2.	Is your employer/client giving you the option to open an EPF account for you? If not, it is possible that you are a contractor for them.
3.	Do you get form 16 or Form 16A? Form 16(including form 16 Part A and Form 16 Part B) are the TDS forms that can only be issued to employees, while form 16A is issued to all vendors except for employees.
Usually terms like paid time off, perks can be an unreliable metric for you to determine if you are an employee or a contractor and the same have not been covered here. It should also be noted, that the HR of the company can also help you determine your employment status.

###Here are a few ways to determine the same for individuals working for Foreign clients/employers:
1.	Are you being employed through any employer of record that your client has in India? If yes, you are probably an employee for them. 
2.	You should look at your 26AS to see the section under which your TDS is being deducted. If the section is not 192 or 192A, it means you are not a salaried employee for your client. Typically, the TDS for freelancers/contractors is deducted under section 194J or 194C. THIS IS THE MOST RELIABLE WAY TO DETERMINE THE EMPLOYMENT STATUS.
3.	In scenarios where no TDS is being deducted, despite your contract income being taxable, it is highly likely that you are a direct contractor for the foreign client and not an employee.
Determining the status with regards to foreign clients can be confusing as the wording of contracts and the HR pitch can be geared towards making you feel like an integral part of the company. However, the law does not look at perks like paid time off, fixed payments to determine your taxability status as there is no restriction to the same being offered to contractors.

Hence, the most reliable way to determine your employment status is to check if any TDS is being deducted on your employment with the foreign client. If not, you are a contractor and you may be eligible to pay taxes on only 50%/6% of your total revenue.",A short guide on how to determine if you are employed as a salaried person or freelance contractor,1.0,2,Freelance,True,2023-10-04 20:48:52,,PM_me_ur_pain,1,10,4,20,48,Wednesday,2.0

"Hey, guys.

I am a recent graduate and got selected at TA in August, 2022. In June, 2023, they said they'd deferred the joining date to possibly June, 2024. But a couple of days ago, I got a call from them informing me that the joining date is being advanced to next month and if I was still interested to join them. The person said we'd be given training initially. I asked if we'd be paid during the training and if we'd be required to attend office during the training. I was told the training would be given as a ""pre-onboarding process"" which is for 6-8 weeks, and that I wouldn't be paid, and depending on the project, I may have to go to office. I was told this is how it is done in most of the companies(which I know is not true, or is it?). And once I finish training and join the company, I'd be given my full-time salary.

I'm kinda anxious about this whole thing as I've read many reviews of TA training freshers for a few months and then fire them on the basis of not qualifying their exam. All of this without pay. If I have to go to office during this training, I have to relocate to another city and will have to shell out 30-40k out of my own pocket.

"Those who use python or javascript or any other dynamic language at work, how do you avoid silly errors due to the nature of the language. 

`function getRandomInt(max) {`  
 `return Math.floor(Math.random() * max);`  
`}`  
`function getLowercasedString (myString){`  
 `if(getRandomInt(2) === 0){ //Expected value is 0 or 1`  
 `return myString.toLowerCase();`  
`}`  
 `return ""There was no problem"";`  
`}`  
`console.log(getLowercasedString());`

&amp;#x200B;

The above Javascript code executes just fine if the random value is 1, but throws an error if the random value is 0 because:  getLowercasedString has an argument that needs to be passed but was not passed when calling it.

So do you write a lot of unit tests ensuring that this does not happen, or do you run the code and manually test every execution path?

"Hello fellow dev community,

Little bit of bio:
I'm a dev with 9 years of work experience as an IC and team lead in capacity (no role of team lead as there were no such official role - basically I was the POC for Managers regarding development activities and timelines and I spoke to other devs regarding timelines tasks and they came to me with tech concerns). I have designed solutions, presented diagrams and architecture to EMs and architects , built those solutions to production. I have experience in service companies, product companies, startups and established ones.

Mostly worked in backend dev(I also have full stack experience ) I have a wide and varied project portfolio - python and frameworks for monoliths and microservices, block chain(actual contract development), AI/ML (actual model training and deployment, vector db).

Right now I'm working in IC capacity with all the above responsibilities. I want to progress to staff engineer role. The reason why I haven't already is (I believe) is some company changes where I did not care for the title and was focused at work and CTC. Even though I have good salary, i haven't progressed in official roles much.

I want to progress to staff engineer/tech lead/architect positions. 

1. How can I be sure that I'm ready for staff engineer role( major imposter syndrome)?
2. What experience should I have in my portfolio?
3. What is the interview going to be like?
4. What skills should I have?
5. What iportant topics I should learn?
6. How can I make a good impression in interviews?

2023 grad here, I was recently connected to a Company via college TPO Cell. It is a reputed Company. Although since, we have already graduated, so we were told that company will itself conduct rounds and communicate with the candidates. 

Anyways, i gave the test and received a call for interview rounds. There were total of 5 interviews and all rounds were elimination rounds. Last wednesday, i had my 5th interview (HR Interview). And i have not heard back ever since then. In between each round, they have taken around 2 days to call me for next round. But this time it has been a week. 

Now since, it is not a start-up so i think they can't just halt the process in between(I guess). Is it normal? How long does it take to actually receive offer or rejection(after 5 rounds?..)?

"I graduated from a tier-3 college and received three job offers:

1. DXC Technology (4.5 LPA)
2. A big tech giant (not FAANG) (6.5 LPA)
3. A Bengaluru startup (16 LPA)(12 base, 3ESOPS, 1other)

During my college days, I used to encourage my friends to do competitive programming and data structures and algorithms (DSA), but they were all too busy with their college lives. I knew that if I didn't do DSA or competitive programming, I would end up with no job offer, so I started learning on my own.

I started with GeeksForGeeks (GFG) and then moved on to LeetCode. I wasn't able to do competitive programming on Codeforces, so I gave up on that and focused on DSA on LeetCode. I also did a lot of development projects to get an internship.

In my final year, I got an internship offer from a Bengaluru startup (45K stipend) and later received a pre-placement offer (PPO) from the same startup(16LPA).

Since I was from a tier-3 college, I struggled to find a good teacher. I wanted to explore more in the field of computer science, so I decided to join the big tech giant (6.5 LPA) which was offering an MTech program.

Before joining, I thought that the teachers would be very good and would teach in-depth. However, the reality is that they are the same as tier-3 teachers. They just read the slides and don't go into depth. I was expecting a lot from the teachers, and maybe there was something wrong with me.

Now, I regret declining the startup offer. My main purpose for joining the company was to do an MTech and explore more CS concepts in depth.

"I recently completed my Master of Computer Application at SCSIT (DAVV) in Indore, which is a tier-3 college. The placement opportunities were promising, with several reputable companies visiting for recruitment. However, there was a 60% eligibility criterion, and I had a 59% score in my 10th grade. Consequently, I didn't even get a chance to participate in the initial round of interviews. During that time, my preparation was reasonable, and I possessed knowledge of basic Java, MySQL, Operating Systems, and some networking concepts.

While some companies had no specific requirements, my coding skills were not strong enough. Even if I managed to pass the coding round, I often faced rejection in the subsequent interview rounds. Only 7-8 companies visited with no specific criteria, and I didn't secure a job. Then, the final semester of college began, and I started working on my final year project. I gained valuable experience from that project, and by the end of college, I had a basic understanding of web development.

After graduating, I began working on several projects and regularly applied on both LinkedIn and job posting websites but no response. It has been three months since I graduated, and while many of my friends have secured jobs with 7-8 months of experience on their profiles, I find myself stuck in web development. I've tried applying to some startups, but they aren't willing to offer a salary for the first 6 months. One company offered a starting salary of 8k for the first year, followed by performance-based increments of 15-20k after a 2-year bond.

"We hired(no one wanted to hire him except one staff engineer who wanted to give him a chance) a fresher in our backend team. He is 4\* codechef, good in DSA but omfg he can't do anything IRL. He can't even design basic schemas and sadly I was assigned to him as mentor. I've tried my hardest to get most of out of him but now it's increasing my blood pressure anytime he sends me ""Hi sir"" for very simple doubts which are just a google search away. His classmate is also in my team and I enjoy working with him because he just gets things done and comes with solutions when stuck.

Some tips for freshers:

1. Learn how to google before asking your seniors. If you are stuck, find solutions and present to your senior, they'll happily help you in chosing better solution but it's frustrating to provide solution to a problem which you din't even investigate enough.
2. Don't expect them to review your PRs as soon as you're done writing code.
3. Learn to read code not written by you. It sucks at first but no way you'd be able to work properly if you can't read someone else's code. Old code might be bad but that's how code evolves.
4. Some task is unclear or ambiguous? Don't wait for seniors to approach you, just message them that what is unclear and what do you think.
5. Have opinions: Just don't trust your seniors to provide the best LLD, if you think you have better ideas, say them out.
6. Books &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Youtube tutorials for learning something new.

"Hello devs of India, I'm a long time lurker in this sub and I got a tier 3 college in CSE,  Counselling took too long so I started CS50X in the meantime and had a pretty rough time with it, So far I'm behind the schedule but still going on

My major concern is I still haven't found what I wish to do in the long run, My seniors/Elder/people in known are telling me to find what I want to do like Backend, Web dev, etc and stick to that, I thought that CS50 has a really nice way of covering everything so I'll figure it out but I'm more than halfway done but still haven't found anything in particular that piques my intrest, I'm more enjoying the process of solving problems like how you do during JEE prep and stuff, Hopefully that changes soon

"Let me explain... As an aspiring programmer I had set foot into college with hopes of learning stacks ,building projects and winning in events. Basically I had pretty high hopes for myself to excel in this field.   
Fast forward to now - as a third year student none of those came into reality. I kinda fell into trap due to me failing in a math subject in my first year, which too was an internal exam no idea why I was so dramatic. There began my downfall, a series of bad decisions, negligent circle of people and poor work ethic - the list goes on....all these made me lose my identity about who I was, what I had to do and I ultimately sacrificed my goals.

I was almost into a pseudo-depression. 

Third year was the much needed wake up call to make me realize how behind I am in this marathon.

I finally decided to return back to my old self (at least gradually..) and participate in events. These events made me realize how out of shape I am - for context couldn't even debug a Fibonacci program in a debugging event - which my first year self would have pretty much aced....

Now why am I happy after all these disappointments you ask? Its because it now gives me a feeling that if I'm failing then I'm doing atleast something right. I also refrained from participation in any events as I feared of not winning and how I would be perceived by people if I lost. I'm slowly trying to erase this thought too.   
Although I should have been at a much better place right now, I guess it isn't a bad time to start?

"Hey guys,

Couple of months back I came across a post on this community which was really motivational about where the op switched after having a 6 month break. It gave me a good idea about the job market and helped me be less scared about the whole affair. It's this one: [https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/149x7dj/details\_walkthrough\_of\_my\_recent\_job\_hunt\_coming/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/149x7dj/details_walkthrough_of_my_recent_job_hunt_coming/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

So, anyway I wanted to make a post about my recent switch too and maybe help someone in the process. 

Details:

* Total experience: 5.5 y (Non-tech 1y3m and Tech 4y2m)
* Old CTC: 6 LPA
* New CTC: 18 LPA (90% fixed, 10% variable)
* Resignation date: 27th May and LWD: 28th August
* Preparation start date: 20th May (I think)

* New company joining date: 13th Sept


Walk through:

I had been working as a QA Engineer for around 4 years(Internship+Permanent Employee). C#, Selenium, MSTest with Hybrid Driven Development Framework. I got tired of my job and felt like I had stagnated. I knew that it was a terrible time to switch but I felt like I had hit a wall in my job and wanted a change. I started applying but most companies would not accept a 3 month notice period. So, I put down my resignation without an offer in hand(Please don't do this, I was going through something in my personal life too and would not suggest someone else to do the same). 

I definitely needed more time to study, I think I wasted 5-6 interviews which could have gone better in the starting two months of my resignation period. Did not get a lot of calls during that time as most companies needed immediate to 15 days joiners. 

In the third month of my resignation period, I got a lot of calls and gave around 35+ rounds of interviews from 15+ companies. 

One of the good things I did was I recorded almost every interview so I could come back later and review the questions that had been asked and prepare them well. Interviewers don't have much time. You need to be crisp and concise in your answers. No one needs to know a 5 minute speech about the difference between interfaces and abstract classes. Just say the two most important points and you're good.

I created accounts on Naukri, Wellfound, Linkedin, Indeed. But I only got calls from Naukri. 

My mistake was that I was not prepared in giving interviews. The way to answer questions, the way to communicate with the interviewer, all of that. And there were so many instances that the questions were being repeated in different interviews but I hadn't prepared well so I lost interviews which could have been salvaged. 

The last week of August was action packed as I gave and cleared almost all the interviews I appeared in. I had specifically mentioned that I was an immediate joined but would later tell the HR that I would join on 15th September basically making the excuse that I need to go to my home town before joining the company. Obviously the company is going to push you to join asap. But if you are confident that you can get counter offers, you should ask them to wait.

In the end I ended up getting offers of 14 LPA (which they increased to 17.7 and later 18 lpa), 16 lpa, 17 lpa. I basically had counter offers due to which the companies ended up increasing their initial offers. The companies will always low-ball you, it's your job to advocate for your self.

I was not expecting my salary to bump up that much. I was hoping for maybe 12 LPA but definitely not 18.

Tips:

* Keep your resume short.
* If applying on Naukri, update your profile everyday
* Practice answering the questions out loud. You could record yourself on a webcam answering questions.
* Record your interviews and review the questions later on.
* Go through most asked questions on google fitting your profile. The interviewers most of the time are looking through the same set of questions.
* Maybe practice a bit of DSA. There's a few list of string related DSA questions that you can check from Google.

Anyway I have been meaning to write this post for a few weeks now and I finally got around to writing it. I am sorry if it's not structured well. I thought I should post it instead of making it perfect. If you have any questions I will be pleased to help.

Things I would do from now on:
1. Give interviews even if I have no intention of switching my company. At the moment I am planning to do it once every quarter. It gives a better understanding of the kind of questions being asked by the companies and also helps you be in practice. 
2. Learn my tech stack in depth BUT learning basics of relevant technologies - breadth instead of depth. Like I am a QA, need to understand in depth of things related to QA but I should also know the basics of networking, sockets, tcp, ssh connections, Java script. It will only help me get a better perspective to work on my profile. 
3. If I am learning something, need to publish articles on medium and lowkey advertise on linkedin. We make the mistake of starting our job search when we are fed up with our current job. But if we are constantly improving ourself and telling the world too(making linkedin articles, publishing on medium) then the opportunity will come to you. Think about it.

"Hey all!.

Sometimes, I get asked this question by freelancers, that they made certain expenses for the business, and how can they claim those expenses, as they are genuine expenses.

The answer to that question and the Tl;dr of this post is that if:
1.	You are opting for 44ADA or 44AD ie you are paying taxes on only 50%(or 6% in case of 44AD) of your revenue, you can not claim any expenses. The government has already factored those expenses when it allowed you to pay taxes on only 50% or 6% of your revenue.
2.	If, however, the expenses are greater than 50%/94% of your revenue, OR you are not eligible for paying taxes on only 50%/94% of your revenue, you can declare your actual expenses, get audited and pay taxes on your actual profit.

Here are some notable examples of this interaction:

1.	If you are working with Upwork, they charge atleast 10% of your revenue as their commission. This means that if client paid you 100k, you only get 90k. However, you will still have to consider whole 100k as your revenue and pay taxes on 50k, and not 45k, as the 10k you spend is business expense.
2.	Let’s say your payment provider charges you 10k rupees to convert your foreign currency into Indian rupee. You can not claim that your turnover is net of that fees. You have to declare your turnover as the money you receive AND add the bank charges on top of it, unless they simply convert the currency at a lower rate, then you can say that the money received is buying rate of the provider.
3.	If you have any employee/sub contractor, the amount you pay them can not be deducted form your total turnover as it is also a business expense and if you are declaring your profit to be 50% of your revenue, you can not claim further expenses.


For the deep divers:

The very first line of the section 44AD and 44ADA states: “Notwithstanding anything contained in sections 28 to 43C” which translates to “Notwithstanding anything written in all the sections that allow you to claim expenses AND direct the way you can claim expenses”.

"So my last company - Quantiphi had conveyed to us that we would be given unpaid internship/ training for 6 months before FTE 2 days before joining. College placements were virtually finished by then so couldn't sit for those. My life went into a spiral after it, stopped going to the gym, gained a few kgs, stopped studying for CAT. My parents as well went about blaming me for not doing B.Tech when there were B.Tech students at Quantiphi suffering the same fate. 

I started doing what is most natural i.e applying to 100s of places. Gave a couple of interviews and reached final rounds of a at least 2 companies but they wanted experience. It felt really disheartening at times having a good interview only to be rejected because of lack of experience. I finally thought maybe I should give CAT this year itself so I started studying again for it but didn't stop applying to places. Now around the first week of september I received a message on my LinkedIn from one of my seniors. He had seen my ""open to work profile"" and inquired about it. He told me his org was taking in freshers and told me send my resume. Sent him got an interview call, then another interview and reached the salary negotiation round wherein they said they would pay 3-4 LPA. I was a bit disappointed by that and asked for at least 7-8 LPA. HR again started with same old but you are fresher na ? I'll see what I can do stuff. I was still feeling a bit disheartened after the call thinking yeh company bhi gaya but to my surprise they did return back with a 7.2 LPA offer and I immediately accepted it. Got my work laptop last week and I am excited to begin work ! (Best part being it's a wfh role). 

The best part about this is the senior I mentioned wasn't even from my major and still reached out to help.

"Hiring is absolutely ridiculous in this country.

Right after graduating, I was nearly hired by a British MNC, however due to recession, my position was put on hold indefinitely. 

Since then, I've reached out to 100s of people on LinkedIn and countless applications on various sites.

Mind you, I've two red-team certifications from INE and a Cloud Practitioner from AWS. I've come across people with no certs, and replying in cheapest unprofessional English working at these MNCs, holding positions as high as Senior Security Analyst. I wonder how were they hired. Folks from NFSU (Finest Security University in India) getting hired by Salesforce and Airbus, despite poor resume, just because they're from a specific university. 

Another friend of mine: holding three certs including OSCP couldn't land a job here, but got a remote job with superior pay.

Do these recruiters have standards? Do they understand what good resume/candidate looks like, or are they satisfied with fifth-rate graduates from selective engineering colleges? 

I was certain of getting picked up by another MNC, considering my profile, but no luck so far. Is it due to recession or something else I wonder.

"Hello fellow developers of r/developersIndia!

My ASUS Vivobook 14 has been frustratingly slow and seems to run too many things in the background, even when I'm not using any applications. It's currently running Windows 11 Home Single Language. To tackle this, I've decided to shift to Linux, and I'm eyeing Ubuntu for its user-friendliness.

Here's a glimpse of my laptop's specifications:

* Laptop: ASUS Vivobook 14
* Processor: 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-1115G4 @ 3.00GHz
* RAM: 8.00 GB (7.70 GB usable)
* Storage: 250 GB SSD, 1 TB HDD
* Current OS: Windows 11 Home Single Language

My primary concern is whether the fingerprint sensor on my laptop will work with Linux, especially Ubuntu. Has anyone managed to make the fingerprint sensor work on an ASUS Vivobook with a Linux system?

Also, I primarily use this laptop for coding, especially web development, and might venture into app development using native or Flutter in the future.

Looking for advice on my career track. If you have been to US and returned after a few years, please help me out. These are my options-

I'm an SDE2 at an okayish MNC. From Tier1 college and looking for a switch(Current TC 35lpa).
1.  I am expecting to get into companies like Amazon easily and aiming for companies like Uber. So a TC of 45lpa+ in India.
2. My company has some openings in US a senior person in team offered to recommend me for those positions. I dont know the exact pay there, but I assume it would be similar percentile. Like my pay in india is not the best, but its among the good ones. 

So what all factors you guys this I should consider? And what are your opinions on it. 
I am currently considering these
1. Away from family - I'm a pretty much community person, I love being with friends and family. My parents are also getting old so dont want to leave them for a long time. 
2. Money - If I spend 2-3 years in USA, will I be able to bring back a good amount of money? In India my expenses are around 10LPA currently. 
3. Career experience - The harsh truth is that US folks work on better tech always. Leadership is there so the big projects are given to those people. We dont have good saas indian startups. 
4. Life experience - I like traveling, and I will be able to travel the whole USA in 2 years. I'll also maybe get more mature having lived in a different kind of environment. It will give me more breadth as a person. 
5. Safety and visa issues - how relevant are the safety, visa, discrimination issues. I'll be going on L2 VISA most probably.

"Hey fellow developers,

I'm currently pursuing my major in CSE at a Tier 2 college(currently in final year) and could really use some advice. I have a strong foundation in CS fundamentals and cybersecurity, and I'm particularly interested in cybersecurity and DevOps. In fact, I hold a CKA certification and have several successful projects under my belt.

However, here's where I'm facing a dilemma. No matter how hard I try, I find it incredibly difficult to enjoy solving DSA . It seems like every tech company out there places heavy emphasis on DSA during their recruitment process. This has left me feeling like all the skills and certifications I've acquired might have been a waste.

I genuinely love developing software, working on cybersecurity projects, and diving into the world of DevOps, but it's disheartening to think that my aversion to DSA could hinder my career prospects.

I'm reaching out to you all for some guidance. Is there anyone who's been in a similar situation or has advice to offer? How can I reconcile my passion for cybersecurity, DevOps, and software development with the industry's insistence on DSA proficiency? Are there specific career paths or companies that prioritise these skills over DSA?

"28 M here.
I graduated in 2018 from a tier-4 college, struggled with backlogs completed my degree later than I should have. No placements. Worked in tech support for 6 months, then switched to a reputed company and worked in IT operations working for an international client.
When COVID hit, our whole department got laid off as the client decided to halt the project indefinitely in March 2020.
There weren't much opportunities during that time, so I took the decision of trying to get into development.
I was also a creative individual and really loved the idea of becoming a frontend developer.
I put in effort and learnt Frontend development and had a couple of projects in my portfolio.
That said and done, I was still not getting hired.
And by the time I got an offer it was March of 2021 from a small company who offered me a frontend dev role.
Even though the pay was peanuts, I had to sign an employement bond for 24 months. I was already unemployed for a year, and as the saying goes, beggars can't be choosers and I took up on the offer.

I was really learning as I was initially trained on both Front-end and back-end(NodeJs). But, 6 months in, my manager resigned. The new manager, who is very dominating, threw me into Database development. 
Refused to give me any frontend/server related work. With the bond in play, I was powerless to refuse the work or request a role of my liking.
I ended up doing database development for a maintenance project. 
2 years later, I am free from the bond but I am in a place where I seemed to have learnt very little from my work. I hate going to work everyday. It has become a pain in the neck.
Now, I want to switch my job and I badly want to get back to frontend. So, friends, please help me find an optimal way out of this company and into the next one and in a role I love(frontend).

"I hope you had a good long weekend.

This is a question that gets asked a lot. Different people have different views on this, and here is mine.

Tl;dr: It is highly recommended to get a GST registration IF you are a service provider who has clients outside India, even though your turnover may not cross 20lakhs. For service providers who only have clients in India, you can get a GST registration after your turnover crosses 20 lakhs.

Here is the logic behind that Tl;dr:

Getting a GST registration can benefit you in 4 different ways. On it’s won, each of the reasons is big enough to justify getting a GST registration. What happens when you add all four into the mix? You can figure it out.

###Reason 1:

The law around this is not clear, and there is not enough evidence to claim that you will not be bothered by GST department. 
•	People who claim that you do not need to have GST registration if you are a service provider who has turnover of less than 20 lakhs usually claim the same because of Notification Number 10/2017- Integrated Tax. 

•	However, the notification may not be observed by the officer in charge of your location and he may argue that the notification is only applicable to suppliers who make supplies in India and not for exporters, as that was the intent of the law. What this means is that you will have to appeal against the order of the officer which can easily take upto 3 annoying years to be settled in YOUR favour. It’s not worth it, especially because the ultimate amount you end up paying is zero.


###Reason 2:

The turnover reported under GST acts as a proof for claiming 44ADA/44AD.

For context, the 44ADA is the section that enables you to pay taxes only on 50% of your revenue from profession. Section 44AD takes that down to 6% for businesses that receive payment through bank.

The sections 44AD and 44ADA are very liberal which what they intend to do. If you qualify for those sections, you do not have to maintain any records or give any proofs to be able to pay taxes on only a fraction of the money that hits your bank account(__the revenue__).

The history of litigation around these sections also shows that as long as you declare the bare minimum( ie 50% or 6%), it is not possible for things to go wrong for you. 

However, the sections place importance on your turnover(or revenue) being reported correctly. Hence, if the need arises(it you get a notice), and you can not prove your turnover, the benefits of the sections can be stripped off( happened to Shivani Builders in 1990s) and you WILL have to report your actual profit(YIKES!).

The turnover you report to GST also acts as a proof of your actual turnover and help you put up a solid defence in case of a Income Tax notice.

###Reason 3:

In a similar fashion to how you can be questioned by Income Tax, you can also be questioned by FEMA, which is the authority that manages the inflow and outflow of foreign currency for India. As some of you might have guessed, because this is a more critical issue compared to Income Tax evasion( possible terrorism vs Tax evasion for personal gain), the authorities are more ruthless. 

However, getting a notice under FEMA is rare at the level of revenue that most freelancers are cashing in.

BUT, in case you do, the GST returns and the FIRCs will act as a proof that you are engaged in a valid business with overseas clients.

###Reason 4:

__Refunds of taxes paid on purchases__

Whenever you make purchases, it is likely that you pay GST on those( an exception being fuel bills). There are a lot of expenses that you may day to day that can be classified as business expenses( like phone and internet bill, purchase of AC or furniture for home office) that have a component of GST charged on the invoices.

If you have a GST registration, you can declare your GST registration number at the time of making these purchases and the credit for GST paid will be added to your account. This means that you can either use the credit to offset GST you would have to pay on your sales, OR you can claim refund of it, in case you are making sales that do not carry GST( in case of exports).

Hence, the expense might turn into a net positive cash flow OR atleast, the refund will soften the total cash expense made for maintaining the GST registration.



That is all, and this is why I personally recommend that regardless of your turnover, you should get a GST registration if you are exporting services out of India.",Why getting GST registration is highly recommended as a freelancer working with foreign clients(even if your turnover is less than 20L),1.0,3,Freelance,True,2023-10-02 21:19:53,,PM_me_ur_pain,1,10,2,21,19,Monday,3.0

2. Alternatively, I could focus less on the technical aspect and pursue an MBA from institutions like ISB or other IIMs. I must mention that my undergraduate performance in Mechanical Engineering (6 CGPA) and 12th-grade scores (52%) might limit my options.

I started my career in a FinTech startup. When I joined, there were only 4-5 employees, and now there are around 200+ employees. When I joined the firm, I barely knew anything about coding, not even the basics, and I was put as an intern. But I grew very quickly there, and now I am a senior software engineer in 3-4 years. From the day I joined until now, I have worked almost 12-16 hours, helping them expand their business in all perspectives.

Recently, the CEO of the company set up a meeting with me and asked me to polish my skills in some more areas, indirectly hinting at working towards becoming the VP of engineering. At that time, it felt more like advice than a concrete plan for me.

Some days later, we went for a party, and one of the senior guys told me that all the top people are considering putting me into a higher role.

Another senior member asked me if I'm interested in moving out of India for a couple of years if the company allows it (which could be a general question).

But what I want to know is, is it possible that they are actually considering me for a VP role? I know VPs are in the top hierarchy and come with a lot of responsibilities. Can a senior software engineer with 3-4 years of experience directly transition into a VP of engineering role, or could they be planning for me to grow into this role gradually over the next couple of years with promotions?

I would love to hear thoughts from experienced engineers. Any suggestions or advice are welcome.

" Hello all,

I'm currently in a bit of a crossroads in my academic and professional journey, and I'd love to hear your thoughts and advice on the path I should take.

I'm a 7th-semester student at a prestigious Tier 1 college in Bengaluru, with placement season already in full swing. I've been passionate about AR/VR/MR (XR) development for the past two years, and I can confidently say that I've honed my skills in this exciting field. In fact, I recently completed an internship at a small startup that focused on virtual and mixed reality, further solidifying my interest and competence in XR development.

Now, as I sit for placements, I'm facing a significant decision. The startup I interned at has offered me a full-time position, but the salary they're offering is relatively low. On the other hand, I have dreams of landing a job with a good company, where the compensation package ranges from 10-14 lakhs per annum. However, my GPA is just above 7.5 out of 10, which might not make me the most competitive candidate for some of these high-paying positions.

My dilemma is this: Should I pursue a traditional software engineering job at a reputed company, potentially earning a higher salary but working on projects that might not align with my passion for XR? Or, should I consider working for a company that may not pay as well but allows me to delve deep into XR development, which I genuinely love?

My resume already boasts a collection of XR projects, but I'm unsure if XR is a stable and profitable tech stack to invest my career in. It's still relatively new, and there are limited companies that specialize in it.

I'm open to advice from experienced professionals, recent graduates, or anyone who has been in a similar situation. What do you think would be the most beneficial path for my long-term career prospects? Your insights would be greatly appreciated as I navigate this critical decision point in my life.

"Hi, I'll try to concisely talk about how I achieved role switch to Software Developer II from Test Engineer II.

2021 Q2 - Join a company as a fresher for Test Engineer Role in 2021, was not aware of distinction between QA, Dev back then. First 8 months did all work. **No personal projects, no self-learning DSA.**

2022 Q1 &amp; Q2 -  Told mentor + management I'm not liking QA work at all and want to shift to dev, was turned down stating team formation, etc. Got depressed, underperforming in every aspect. **1 personal project related to Trading out of interest, no DSA.**

2022 Q3 - Realised current company can't provide it. Started upskilling alongside code reading. I worked on following things :-

* Reading code of current product. Being QA, I had insight of workflow end to end which helped. The aim was to understand enough that I can write it in my resume &amp; defend.
* Started doing neetcode 150, followed its roadmap, any doubts for data structure/algorithms just watched over youtube. All this in Python as I'm familiar with the language.
* Started my own project ideas to enrich resume &amp; get more proficient with python language.
* Read and did few system design questions alongside projects to keep both things inline 

2022 Q4 - Dealt with mental breakdowns with following things :

* Continued code reading, asked doubts, made notes.
* Changed mindset to more positive outlook that things will happen in my favour as long as I am working hard.
* Took a pause for 3 weeks as I was barely sleeping.
* Started giving hints to management I will pursue my goal with/without their support in form of code snippet, personal projects.

2023 Q1 &amp; Q2 - Drafts &amp; drafts of resume! As per my features understanding I kept updating resume current one is v7.

* **Neetcode questions**!!! A lot of them with sincerity and started submitting resumes, interviews (have fucked up few due to lack of practice).
* Continued everyday solving some question which required thinking. Skipped over those which I already could solve.
* Started learning **spring boot + Java** as many JDs I observed were asking for the same and started reading code of Java backend within the team.
* Integrated **system design concepts** in projects / machine coding questions.
* Kept making my requirement clears to current company.

Next steps - Going to continue with same things with same mindset.

* Started solving striver's sheet now as I've solved neetcode questions but revision of those is equally imp for certain data structures like Graph.
* Mock interview with help of friend to identify &amp; improve my questions. Have been supporting my other friends for same.
* Prepare for FAANG level. Just more efforts and question solving!
* Worked on code for 2 different projects for internal company hackathon.
* Valuable projects! Have 2 more in pipeline to wrap up. Will continue with those. Planning to finish in  3-4 months leading to most time for pure DSA questions.

I recently got an opportunity to work directly with Salesforce as a client but the opportunity was given to me by a start up. The payroll is under the start up but the client is Salesforce. 
Now due to some medical emergencies, I conveyed them that I wouldn't be able to work with start up and thus with Salesforce.
Now the HR is telling me that if I don't join the start up, Salesforce would blacklist me , since they have already sent the laptop from Salesforce and they have already created an account in Fieldglass for myself.

She told me further that medical reasons are very common and 90% of the people do that and she has seen in her 6 years of career, Salesforce blacklisting people for the same.

Is it true?

It was always my dream to work with Salesforce but now she is telling me all these ,which is giving me chills , my joining date is tomorrow, so need urgent reponse on this.

"I was out of job for a month and in the meanwhile I had applied for several companies out of which I got selected in a startup for 25lpa. 

A week before my joining one of the VPs of a dubai based company reached out to me for a job opportunity in india. I cleared the first tech round, then hr round (i said about my standing offer to the HR also mentioned about joining date as next week, so requested them to fast track the process), then 2nd tech round with another VP, then cultural fit round with a HR VP, then a bar raiser round with a SVP.

HR said the interviewers of 2nd tech and cultural fit round gave a ""very positive review "" (not sure if this really means something or just a standard HR talk). Anyways my final round was scheduled with SVP,  things were okayish in the bar raiser round. He kept cross questioning my experience and suggesting he was looking for a more detailed or different answer (not sure if he was just testing my skills there). But yeah I think it wasn't bad either, it was fine but not so great either. 

Final round was completed last Friday, I reached out on Tuesday indicating the HR about my urgency since I have a standing offer with deadline. She mentioned ""I will be able to provide feedback on Thursday"". Reached out on thu evening, no response. Friday was Eid, sat sun weekend. 

I'm not sure if I should be positive or give up hope here. Feeling positive because HR said she will provide feedback on a specific date, and didn't inform about not being selected. Giving up hopes day by day because of this delay, it's been more than a week since the final round now. Though I told about my pending offer there us no response yet on my candidature 

(Note: I have joined the other company in this meanwhile since they won't extend my offer any further)

"Hey all! I am back. For those who thought I stopped writing because I got banned, you are an awfully positive person and I love you. I was busy with tax audits and had to stop writing for a while.

**Your total Income will be calculated with:**

1. 100% of your salary(100% as in salary after the normal deductions available for salaried income, like Standard Deduction, HRA
2. 50% of your freelance/contract revenue for the year, provided you do not cross the upper limit for this exemption(75 lakhs as at the time of writing this post). If you earn more than this limit of exemption, you will have to declare your actual profit(Revenue-Expenses).
3. 100% of your other Income(like interest/dividend/capital gain) will be added as it is normally added for calculation of your total income.
4. Deduction as normally available to you will be allowed, if you are opting for old scheme.

With this calculation you will arrive at your Total taxable income and you will be taxed according to the applicable slab rates. Depending on whether you choose old scheme or new scheme.

*Moreover, it does not matter if you had freelance income for X months in a year and salary Income for Y months. Your total income is aggregated at the end of the year.*

## The logic behind this calculation:

The Income tax act allows you to classify your income into various categories(called heads) to allow better and fairer taxability. This means that a person may be entitled to different rates of deductions and taxes depending on the source of Income.

A great example of this principle is applicability of a flat 10% tax on long term capital gain on sale of listed securities. This is done to ensure continuous investments into certain areas(like listed businesses) while also deterring people from investing into other areas( like cryptos) which are heavily taxed.

The government of India wants to foster small businesses and professionals AND hence, the formalities and the tax rate is lower compared to medium and large businesses. This also means that the government only allows your Income from Business or profession to be taxed at a lower rate and not other incomes (like salary). Which is why only freelance/contract income can be shown under 50% benefit and not all of the incomes.

I recently graduated and have received offers from two companies. The first, a significant MNC (Company 1), and the second (Company 2).

Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, my joining date with Company 1 has been delayed. In the meantime, I have signed the offer letter with Company 2. However, upon reflection, I realize that this opportunity doesn't align with my long-term goals, particularly due to a 2-year bond and a financial commitment of 2.5 lakhs.

I have expressed my preference to my placement cell officer to join Company 1, which I believe would be a better fit for me. However, I am facing resistance, with the officer indicating potential consequences such as withholding my Leaving Certificate and Letters of Recommendation.

I am hesitant to join Company 2 because of the bond agreement. While I'm not afraid, I am uncertain about the best course of action. I'm concerned that the placement cell officer may communicate with both companies to discourage them from accepting me.

I would greatly appreciate any advice or guidance on this matter. Thank you.

But whenever there's a major functionality to be implemented my seniors code it in react/typescript. I have been given these tasks before but since i could not complete them, the seniors started taking them up. And ong, the code they write scares me. They code faster than I can think of a solution and this demotivates me everyday. Everytime they code something and add in the codebase i have to take few hours out and understand everything.

"Hello fellow developers,

I'm a recent graduate from the 2023 batch of a tier 3 college and I'm quite proficient in full-stack development. Additionally, I have a good problem-solving skills in DSA questions using CPP. Currently, I find myself unemployed and eagerly awaiting a good opportunity. Fortunately, I've received two job offers simultaneously.

The first offer is from a mid-tier company with approximately 300 employees. They're looking for a Frontend Developer experienced in JavaScript frameworks and libraries. The compensation they're offering is 4 LPA, and the position allows for remote work.

On the other hand, the second offer comes from an early-stage startup based in London with 35 employees. They are offering a higher salary range of 8-10 LPA. However, the catch is that this company specializes in Microsoft PowerApps, a no-code development platform, and the role requires me to work in Gurugram.

Now, the main question I'm facing is whether to choose the company offering 4 LPA, where I can work in a coding profile that I've practiced for several years, or opt for the higher-paying job that involves working with a no-code platform. I'm unsure whether the latter choice will add significant value to my resume in the long run.

I'm seeking advice from experienced professionals who may have faced a similar dilemma. Your insights would be greatly appreciated.

Note: I have more than one backlog.

Positions offered: 
1. Digital Marketing champion - 8.5 L over 2 years
2. Digital operations analyst - 2.36 L 
3. Business operations analyst - 8.5 L over two years. (Pune/Bangalore)

I'm thinking of applying for the 3rd role as my skill and interest more align with it. As far as I've researched about the role, I will be the person interacting with the clients/business understand their needs and requirements and prove suggestions and solutions and then communicate with the technical team. 

You need to have good communication skills and some technical skills for the role and they company says ""interest in marketing is a plus"" in job requirements section, as I did an Neuromarketing workshop I think it'll benifit me.

What are the reviews about the company?
If any Business analyst/Operations analyst please explain about the role
What the role offers for me?
What does 8.5 L over 2 years mean? What will the CTC breakdown look like?
How should I prepare for the role?
For Aptitude more focus on quant or verbal?
Should I start to learn Power Bi ?
I am quite good at web development especially back end so should I pitch that as well in the interview?
Should I choose Bangalore if I get the offer? I feel I'd be exposed to many more opportunities in Bangalore.

My college's average package is 5.1 L so please don't judge over the package and I have backlogs so even 4L is a good job for me at the moment. I'll be preparing for GRE next year so I'm not looking to stay forever in the company.

"(clickbait intro) you could say I'm one of those people in this sub who lurked around here for placement startegies and whatnot ,now  wanting to enjoy more from it is that I actually do or am expected to do. 
 
I got into programming 3 years ago and have spent quite some time on games and web , although to find a reliable roadmap for games was hard as there is not much exposure in india , it was  incredibly easier for web dev .

 It was simple for me to ask what I had to work on , I'm leaving out my experience with games for now , for web dev I finished the Odin project and developed the final social media website that they recommend , got an internship which I simultaneously did along my college for about 2 months , practised around 48 problems on leetcode and got on a company live project which helped me get placed with a package which I'm very happy with . My work will tentatively start around the Jan Feb period and I'm looking for skills that I could learn that will make me stand out especially from copy paste programmers (not shaming the practice).

 Now that I'm out of the rat race , I wonder what I should work on or look into especially with Gen AI changing how we code substantially . 

Lately I feel working on development has changed a lot ,with chat gpt I can get away with not learning a thing such as a framework ( can also be something like math or a well known algorithm such as a star) without actually knowing it completely and have a functional program. And I get that this is the way it has to be with good code as in it maintains separation of concerns . Then I ask myself the question , what the heck did I do apart from putting it all together which IMO is not hard . 

To give an example of how I feel , it's sort of like I'm learning to call model.fit and model.predict but at a bunch of places in my code . I do know how to maintain SOLID and DRY principles but my question is what can I learn now that I know these things  while still learning stuff that is actually helpful

1) Leetcode is challenging and fun but from what I've heard in this sub it's something people only pickup and grind for interviews . Personally i think , with the approach I followed for the meagre amount of 48 questions , it helped me learn how to think more than just learn the underlying techniques .

2) Develope a project : now I get that anything I learn , I have to make a project on it to truly get the essence of it .But the thing is that my work has an training period and whatever relevant stuff I need to know I can learn it better there instead of having a rough idea on what it is that I should work on . 

If I do something related to development , id like to be on the backend side of things as I think frontend is relatively easier . 
I am relatively framework agnostic and do not want to get into framework specific problems 

Im essentially trying to make my work interesting and what could help is if you guys could recommend me conferences like how there is GDC for games but for backend engineering .","What is something challenging , fun and useful skill (not technology) that I explore now that I am out of the rat race",1.0,1,General,True,2023-09-30 21:29:05,,Competitive-Ad8731,1,9,30,21,29,Saturday,1.0

"Finished class 10th, was in a delusion that I was a smart kid. JEE made me realize how dumb I really was. Joined a tier 3 college near Delhi NCR. My dad was disappointed in me, he thought my kid will go to an IIT and make him proud.

Started working from the first year itself, still remember the first time I was on CodeChef. I don't remember the question but it was very basic. I couldn't solve it. It took me 1.5 hours and I wasn't even able to solve the question.

Went to hackerrank, solved a lot of warmups and basics. It helped me build on my basics. Went back to CodeChef. Practised a lot, now was able to solve 1 question. Started solving 1 question each day, most of the times I had to look at the code. Learnt a lot of things. Dreamt of becoming a red (LoL). After about 4-5 months of practice I was able to get to 3 stars in CodeChef. Felt amazing, honestly. 

Someone said go on CodeForces and that litreally gave me anxiety, people solving question in 1 min while I wasn't even able to solve it in 2 hours. Grinded a lot on Codeforces but it never worked for me. I never got any success on CodeForces. Started to feel I wasn't good.

Thought of learning development, React was popular as always. Tried learning it, but nothing made sense, I wasn't even able to understand anything. Tried learning Django, again the same. What was I even learning? It affected my mental health, had a breakdown. Litreally was crying in my room as I wasn't even able to grasp the basic concepts. Tried to ask seniors for help, but I was mostly an introvert so didn't had a really good connection with anyone. Some replied, most were busy with their work. This was during Lockdown. Ended up hating coding and thought I should look for a different career. This is not for me.

Spent the rest of the lockdown playing MineCraft and Stardew Valley. College opened again. I was in third year and didn't knew a thing. I left CP because of the anxiety in CodeForces and also because it felt like JEE prep. Saw students starting CP now, I felt I wasted all my time and I was at the same point as the others.

But it was third year, my mental health problems isnt gonna make me money LoL. This time I tried learning Flask, and this was the breakthrough. Frameworks like Django hide a lot of details so you never understand what is even happening. Flask made me understand what was happening. Shifted back to Django since now I knew how stuff was working.

Made my first project. Tried to develop it as if it were a professional one, and added every feature I could think that a user might want. Posted it on Reddit for feedback. (on my previous account - deleted it now). A guy texted me, he liked it and wanted to interview me for an internship position in his startup.

Both the founders were ex-googlers, my confidence was on 9th sky. I gave the interview, was rejected. They might have found someone better. A mid-tier company came to college, they were giving 12LPA. Lots of us applied. They butchered us in the interview, I wanted to quit it in between. It was that bad. Trees, Graphs they asked everything.

I felt really pathetic. For a week straight I just learned everything I could about trees and graphs, made notes, solved LeetCode problems. Another company came. It was a startup 7LPA + Internship (10k stipend). I applied and this time I got it.

Was happy, started working there. Soon realized it wasn't gonna work. Finances were not good, everything was written by interns. Only a tech lead and senior engineer were there, the entire codebase was written by interns. I started looking for other internships.

At this point, I knew I wasn't good at LeetCoding and I was okay with it. I wanted to work with startups, wanted to build and work on something I could be proud of.

Started applying for new internships at Cuvette, got 2 offers. Both from startups, one gave me Intern + FTE, while other was Intern only. The Intern only statup had already got a seed funding of around 5.7 Million, had co founders who worked at CodeNation, Microsfot, PhonePe.

I took a gamble, went with them. I delivered every task on time, trying to make sure that code quality was at it's best. They liked it. Offered me a PPO, 12LPA.

Currently working as a SDE 1 there. Enjoying my time.  


## Lessons
- **Don't give up**- try to look for help, do whatever you can, it took me three years to finally love programming and today I am good at it. Maybe you're at a bad place but it's okay you're gonna make it. If I can, so can you.
- **Enjoy the journey**- All this time when I wanted to work in FAANG, or wanted to be red on CF I had a destination in mind and all it gave me was anxiety and depression. I got success only after I enjoyed the journey, for me which was coding and building projects.
- **Learn how to learn coding**- [This](https://www.youtube.com/@bigboxSWE) is an amazing youtube channel that will help you on how to learn. It is different than History or Physics. We can't just open the documentation and try to read and learn. You need to practice. I created 10 stupid CRUD apps before I created a first decent CRUD app.
- **Respect your work**- I see a lot of people, even people from my class who don't know anything but refuses to work for anything less that 7LPA. You need to know you're starting at the bottom. Now people might not agree with this, but you need to get in the industry before you can make it big. You as a fresher need to get in. Not happy? Keep looking, keep preparing but rejecting offers because someone you know who is dumber got an offer from Microsoft isn't gonna get you anywhere. Everyone has a different story.
- **Always be humble**- Just a personal piece of advice, arrogance is gonna take you nowhere. If you know more than someone, help them! Don't make fun of them. Everyone is a beginner at some point.
- **Don't compare**- Someone dumber than you might earn 40LPA. You need to focus if you're happy or not. Are your needs and wants satisfied? Trying to get the highest salary ain't gonna work.
- **Be open to different paths**- FAANGs are not the only companies in the world. If you don't like CP, it's okay. There are different paths.","Hey Guys!

"I want to address something before anyone comments on it. The field I'm in is vast, and I find it challenging to decide where to begin. Currently, I have just over 1 year of experience at a witch company, where I've received best possible ratings and raises. However, my current role has started to feel routine. I'm eager to acquire new skills, potentially increase my salary within the next 6-8 months, or even consider switching to a different role.

Here's what I already know:

Languages: Advanced in Python, Basic knowledge of the .NET stack and Java.
My current responsibilities involve occasional use of Python and Java. I mainly work with Kubernetes configurations (YAML files), API gateways, and have basic experience with Azure Cloud, along with some scripting.

At my job, my knowledge is still at a beginner level for most technologies, and I'm starting to find it monotonous. I'm eager to explore new areas and increase my earning potential. I would greatly appreciate any suggestions from experienced individuals on what I can further specialize in and new skills I can acquire. I'm not interested in cloud support roles and have a strong inclination towards architecture.

A brief intro.

Btech- tier 1.5, YOE-1. Current CTC-13 LPA, Current role- frontend engineer.

Past Acads- 9/8/8. GEM

Gave CAT in 22 without any prep since all my friends were giving and got 88%. Due to my job committments and the fact that I was unsure of whether to stay in tech and MBA, started MBA prep quite late( around 2 weeks back). I am scoring about 50 marks in mocks, I feel I can get upto 97-98 at max in CAT 23. I dont think I can score 99.5+ this year to get old IIM/FMS call.

Long story short I kind of like working as a frontend engineer, but I am not that much of a coder.(as in I cant do DSA(DSA is a skill one needs in order to get jobs in FAANG/unicorn startups where the CTC is on par with Old IIMs(25 LPA).

I feel I have really good speaking and communication skills and I am better off working as a PM/consultant in the long run.

**Can anyone say what are the MBA colleges its worth for me to get in**, provided I need to take a full loan and the opportunity cost- I feel I'll touch 16 LPA CTC in current org in 2 years and can reach 20 LPA CTC within 2 years if I switch.

Should I target colleges like SIMB/NMIIMS are they worth it?

I checked out profiles of folks who get into colleges outside the top 8 colleges(old IIMs/FMS/XLRI)(majority are Btech grads with 4-5 LPA jobs and non engg folks).

"I'm kinda stumped, so looking for any suggestions or pointers. I'm new to my company and they have been facing this issue for over two months. Initially there were only one or two orders so they could manage but recently the numbers have increased so much that manually managing this is impossible.

Thing is my company has a server, let's say 192.168.1.25 on their network. 

It runs a flask app on one of the ports say 7600
which is an API endpoint.

We have an ERP running live on the same network. The flask app 7600 listens for post requests at /order.

What this api basically does is it gets data for one order and pushes it into the ERP and generates invoice, a copy of which is generated in XML format in the 1.25 server local directory.

There is another inventory management 3rd party vendor  who have a web app which communicates with this post and generates an invoice. 

Our user clicks a button ''close order"" on this 3rd party site, but clicking the button doesn't obviously does not fire the flask api. But the API usually works unless it doesn't. We don't know what exactly goes behind their inventory management system but they get an error 500 internal system error with a log file about the API http://192.168.1.25:7600. It also contains the headers and payload data.

Note  one thing both me and that vendor needs to connect to my company's Forticlient VPN to access that api.

This error 500 does not happen for all orders but only for some. Resending from the 3rd party app doesn't help. If one order post fails IT always fails for that order.

But here is the thing I connected my dev computer to the VPN, took the log file sent by the 3rd party vendor. Posted the same request with the same payload but i get 200. Same for all the failed orders. The log file is generated for each failed order by them.(3rd party inventory management guys).

Would also like to mention that the log file has something listed as a source: xyz proxy server. The 3rd party guy told that they use proxies.
Could that be an issue why they are not able to connect. Could it be that some of their proxies are not configured properly that makes our api server return 500?

Hello everyone, I am facing an issue at my job currently and need advice to tackle this. I work at a bank, and develop banking software. To push the changes to production we require a lot of approvals and it very lengthy and verbose process called as CR(change request). I am junior developer with 1+ years of experience. So my scrum, BA and tech lead all have over estimated and took a lot of people into the team in the beginning of the year without enough work for all. 

Uptill July we had huge work, mainly on Ui side. I worked hard and completed a 20 something jira tickets. This was till July. During this period as I was the junior and I was doing well with CRs, all the CRs were being imposed on me where ideally it should be done rotationally by every team member. My team consists of two modules. Let's call it A and B. I work on module A. From July i requested for some back-end tasks as well. In July, i was assigned a huge backend task, without knowing that it was the main part of requirement. This was my first backend task and I have never done it before. I took my time with and completed the task in little over one week.

 After that, there was change in the data structures and the design. So I had to hold my task for additional 2 weeks. Till July I had a lot to show for, but from July as there no tasks assigned to me and some tasks which were assigned to me were being assigned to others in the team by my teach lead. My tech lead forced me to do CRs, so that I can skip the tasks. This month, something happened which pissed me off totally. I was assigned 2 tickets for the whole month. As I was working on a CR my tech asked my teammates to complete my tasks as well. So what I did was complete the CR first and then work on my task. Shortly i received a call from my tech lead saying that I have complete module B's CR as well. I took this to my scrum and current manager ( my manager changed this year), who is also a developer in module B. To avoid conflicts i completed that as well. After that I was on medical leave. So one ticket was completed my by tech lead and another was assigned to other teammate. As soon as I was back from the leave, i took the ticket from her without anyone's permission and completed it on time, which nobody noticed. 

Previously I also took this to point my manager in the yearly reviews. Now, he contacted my scrum regarding this and my scrum says i take too much time that's why I was assigned CRs only. I only took time for one ticket, but the subsequent tickets were delivered on time. I really did not expect this from him as he is very friendly with me. From July to end of year I will hardly have 5 tickets to my name. 5 tickets for 6 months. I was scared and pissed off. 

What should I tell my manager in the end of the year if he asked me why I had done so less work? Due to my scrum and BAs incapability, I have to suffer. Every other teammate has a lot to show for, but me - nothing. That's why I took to my manager. My manager asked me to get the evidence ready, so I got it ready and sent it to him. Everyone in my team has some work to show for the year, but not me. This naturally decides my hike. Soon my senior managers will be contacting me for this. What is the right thing to do in this situation? Please help, I'm confused.

"Hi fellow IT professionals,

I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to reach out to this knowledgeable community to seek some advice on a situation I'm currently facing at work.

Recently, my employer has announced their intention to bring all employees back to the office and discontinue the work-from-home option that many of us have been enjoying.

I'm looking for guidance on how to negotiate the terms of this return to the office, especially in light of the changing landscape of work in the post-pandemic world. Has anyone successfully negotiated for a flexible or hybrid work arrangement with their employer? If so, what strategies did you use, and what points did you emphasize in your discussions?

I believe it's important for IT professionals to have a voice in these matters, as we've proven that remote work can be effective in our field. I'm hoping to gather some insights, tips, and success stories from those who have been through a similar situation.

first parameter is the pageLimit that you want to set and second one is the current page that you are on.

So if you are on page 1 and you want to send connects to 10 pages. you will invoke it like thisconnect(10, 1);

I think you guys can build on top of that, like you can probably extract their names and links and sync it to some Database. You can connect using some kind of keyword.

The post was loved by a lot of you. More than 450 people joined and a number of those people have not only come together to work on the [Devta](https://github.com/techrail/devta) project (that was in focus back then), but have also collaborated real well to build the [Bark](https://github.com/techrail/bark) project. It would not have been possible without the amazing inputs and efforts of the members who joined the little Open Source Initiative called Techrail. A total of 4 people from in there have risen to the status of repo maintainers as well.

We are still holding our 9 PM calls almost daily - we talk about the progress of multiple projects that we have, we discuss best practices for each project, what we wanna do (and why) in coming days and a lot about tech in general. This daily call has helped us a *lot* in moving at a much faster pace. In addition, we also hold a live coding session once a week (usually on Saturdays) where we code together to fix a set of issues to push the projects further. It is because of this working pattern that we have been able to push the **Bark** project to its release within just 20 days. Please allow me to briefly introduce both the projects:

1. [**Bark**](https://github.com/techrail/bark) is a small tool that allows you to send log statements to a PostgreSQL database rather than a logfile. It is supposed to be a stepping stone between logfile and the ""Terabyte-scale, enterprise-ready APM and Log Aggregation and Analytics platforms"" (yes, that is a mouthful) which are a bit difficult to setup and operate. It is far from being feature-rich but it is stable, is high-performance and does what it says.
2. [**Devta**](https://devta.techrail.in) is an frontend-only web application which offers a set of small, handy tools useful to developers that we use in our day-to-day development workflows.

Now, September is ending and October is about to begin. And that means that [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is around the corner. In case you're unaware, the [registration](https://hacktoberfest.com/auth/) for it is open. Hacktoberfest allows you to add a star to your profile which is well-recognized around the world for being a quality event. For anyone who is willing to improve their job profile, especially freshers, Hacktoberfest presents a great opportunity

We are putting up both Bark and Devta up for participation in Hacktoberfest (we have tagged both repositories for the same). We have 3 maintainers for each project; both other maintainers were added as maintainers because of their involvement with the projects. We would love if you people would be ready to join our journey to [make something useful in the open source space](https://techrail.in). We have multiple projects which we would love to have more contribution and brainstorming on. We would love to have you on [GitHub](https://github.com/techrail) as well as [Discord](https://discord.gg/aKkWFghPrV).

Now, just in case you do not want to join *our community* but still want to participate in Hacktoberfest, you should head over to their website and register as soon as possible (registration closes on September 30th). Then go to GitHub and search for [repositories that have been tagged with Hacktoberfest topic](https://github.com/topics/hacktoberfest).

"Hey guys, this my first monthly post where I try to learn a new technology at the start of the month and then write a summary-ish on what I've learned and [this](https://github.com/Shot-Anybody-6431) is my GH account where I might do a project on the tech I've learned. It is very rough draft so if I haven't included anything or wrote something wrong, please let me know :)
## [Autodistill](https://github.com/autodistill/autodistill)
Autodistill is a computer vision library that was first released on Jun 8 2023 ( I think). It uses big, slower foundation models to train small, faster supervised models. Using `autodistill`, you can go from unlabeled images to inference on a custom model running at the edge with no human intervention in between. Docs link [here](https://docs.autodistill.com/).

Features include:
* Object Detection
* Instance Segmentation
* Automatic Data Annotation (will explain about this later)
* Training models using YOLOv8 and others
* Delpoying models to cloud or edge


Some of the foundation/base models include: 
* [GroundedSAM (Segment Anything Model)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything)
* [DETIC](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detic)
* [GroundingDINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO)

And the target models include:
* [YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once)](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
* [YOLO-NAS](https://github.com/Deci-AI/super-gradients/blob/master/YOLONAS.md)
* [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
* and [DETR](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/detr)

![Image of how autodistill works](https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e726f626f666c6f772e636f6d2f6f70656e2d736f757263652f6175746f64697374696c6c2f636f6e6e656374696f6e732e6a7067.webp)

## Reasons to use
Creating object detection models in time-intensive task. You need to label the data, train the model, and then deploy it. Autodistill automates this process by using the foundation models to label the data and then also train the target models. This is a huge time saver (trust me I know) and allows you to focus on other things.

## How it works
To use `autodistill` you input unlabeled data into a Base Model which uses an Ontology to label a Dataset that is used to train a Target Model which outputs a Distilled Model fine-tuned to perform a specific Task.

Definitions:
+ __Task__: The task you want to perform (ex. object detection)
+ __Base Model__: A model that is used to label the data (ex. GroundedSAM)
+ __Ontology__:  An Ontology defines how your Base Model is prompted, what your Dataset will describe, and what your Target Model will predict. Say you want to use to predict cars, so you're 'Ontology' would be 'car'.
+ __Dataset__: The dataset that is created by the Base Model and used to train the Target Model
+ __Target Model__: The model that is trained using the Dataset and used to perform the Task (ex. YOLOv8)
+ __Distilled Model__: The final model that is fine-tuned to perform the Task.

Though it seems perfect, there are its limitations such as:
* The Base Model must be able to label the data i.e if the ontology that you've provided it too specific or too complex, it won't be able to label the data.
* The Base Model must be able to label the data with a high accuracy. If the Base Model is not accurate, then the Target Model will not be accurate.
Autodistill's Base Models can already create datasets for many common use-cases (and through creative prompting and few-shotting we can expand their utility to many more), but they're not perfect yet

## Installation
Autodistill is modular and can be installed in parts. You can install the library using `pip install autodistill`. You can also install separate dependencies such as `pip install autodistill autodistill-grounded-sam autodistill-yolov8`.

You can also refer [this](https://colab.research.google.com/github/roboflow-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/how-to-auto-train-yolov8-model-with-autodistill.ipynb) Colab Notebook created by [Roboflow](https://www.roboflow.com/) on how to get started with Autodistill.

"Okay so recently I had applied for a fresher role in an MNC. I got through the first round and now for the second round they are taking cognitive coding assessments physically. They provided a survey form in the first half of this month and gave us options to choose the date and location. Naturally (and I hope not only me) chose a location nearest to my city since none of the options available had the my city name on it. So obviously I now need to travel.

After about 20 days, I didn't get any kind of confirmation regarding the date and location I had chosen. I even sent a mail to the recruiting team or ""campus recruitment"" asking about the confirmation but no response. My date of assessment was coming near maybe a week was left so decided to book the tickets anyway since who knows tickets might be available later on. Even booked a hotel for accomodation.

Yesterday, I got an email. The mail had my admit card on it and the date was not the one I opted for. Instead it's on 30 September at 9 AM. Instantly I sent an email about this even sent proof of my form submitted and my admit card. Went to the site, raised a ticket. 

Now at present, no response to the mail sent and the ticket which I had raised has been closed showing that the issue is solved. The issue was infact not solved when I checked on the site and had no response to my queries.

" 

I belong to a tier third college in India. I was into marketing, graphic designing, video editing, and UI/UX for a large portion of my college life so I couldn't code a lot during the initial years. I'm above average in my academics (8+ GPA) and have been very active in college societies.

I'm not very good at coding (Leetcode 130+ questions so far) I can understand most of the logic but I still haven't developed the thinking to solve a medium/above medium-level problem completely on my own. I code in Java.

As for my projects, I have done two mini projects in Python (but I'm only average with the language), built one e-commerce clone so far, and a couple of very small personal projects: a parallax website, a password generator with additional features, etc. I've one internship under my belt where I have worked on a live website.

I'm learning React, I've worked with databases before so my SQL is fairly strong, and I'm also familiar with Linux OS, know how to use git properly, and so on. It's just my coding part that is lacking, and *practice.*

I want to get a decent on-campus placement/internship before this year-end, *(Please, don't go about telling me that I'm bad at coding, have no experience or good projects, etc., so I won't get placed,* ***I'm really not asking this to hear that***)

If not a decent on-campus placement, then an okay-ish off-campus placement. I believe that if I work super hard for two-four months, I can become marginally better at things. **I just want to know what steps I should follow to do that.**

I'm ready to study 10-12 hours a day. I still need to get a lot better at trees, graphs, and DP. I'm also not very good with stack and queue. On campus, they usually ask for strings, Hashmaps, two-pointers, linked lists, or arrays and I believe I'm fairly good with them. I know that for off-campus, I'll need to study harder.

*I'll also share my resume soon to get a reality check, but the day is not today.*

What I want to know is how should I approach coding now. What questions should I take on? What projects should I build and what algorithms should I have on the tip of my fingers? (Usually follow striver's list or Arsh Goyal's DSA sheet) Apart from that, how should I prepare for tech as well as HR interviews?

Please any tips or methods will help. If you'd tell me how to start preparing from now on, I'll follow through that religiously. I think I know almost all concepts, but I need to do a thorough revision too (both theory and coding).

Also, on-campus, **the companies coming to college are kind of shitty**, offering 3-5 LPA (that'll be hard to survive on) and having 2-3 year bonds, etc. I'm still in my 7th semester so I do know that I have time, but I want at least one base placement/internship right now so that I have some level of security.

"Hello fellow devs,

I'd like to share our startup story with you today, and it comes with mixed emotions as we bid farewell to our very first venture. (TL;DR at the bottom)

Me and my 5 friends (5 from B.Tech. and 1 from B.Tech + LLB) had a brilliant idea. However, we made our fair share of rookie mistakes right from the start. 

Our very first (And the biggest) mistake was that we didn't do any sort of market research. We just came to the conclusion that if we think people need this then people actually need this.... 

Our second mistakle: Didn't plan anything.  We coded away without a clear plan in mind. The result? An absolute mess, 5 noob coders with vastly different coding styles and no professionalism. Oh god the code base was garbage. We all agreed it was shiiit. We realized our mistake and began again, this time with a better plan, resulting in a codebase that, while not perfect, was at least serviceable. It took us a year and a half to get to this point. 

Finally, when we got the tech resolved we started searching for the investers. It's extremely hard to even get a chance to talk to the investors when you are 19yo second year studfent from a tier 3 college. Those interested in investing were demanding a staggering 75% stake in our company – an offer we couldn't accept.

We got tired of investor hunting and thought let's bootstrap it (Turns out it was a good idea in the end). We pooled our resources, registered the company, purchased a domain, and launched the website. 

Third mistake: We thought an investor only brings money to the company. But NO!!! they also bring connection and experience, I regularly think it might have been different if we had an investor with industry connection and industry experience.

Initially, we experienced some success, likely due to the support of our family, college friends, and teachers. However, our earnings were far from substantial, and it took us eight months to break even. 

Unfortunately, things took a turn for the worse after eight to nine months. Our customer base dwindled, returning customers became scarce, and new customers from ads barely stuck around. We were barely breaking even and heading downhill fast. 

Last Sunday, we held a final meeting and collectively decided to shut down the company. Starting on Monday, we began the process of winding down our services: we surrendered the domain, deleted the database, took down the hosting, archived the GitHub repository, and closed our mailing service account. We also initiated the cancellation of our GST registration. While the technical aspects are sorted out, there's still some legal work to complete. As I write this, I've just closed the last chapter by shutting down our mailing service account. Now, I'm pondering what's next.

Because we kept the company bootstrapped we have zero debt, and no pressure from any investor.

I have a job, so I'm not unemployed, but our startup used to be the driving force that motivated me to return home early from the office and continue working in the evening. Now, my evenings will be empty. 

Nonetheless, I'm grateful for this experience. We learned a great deal, not only about technology but also about the legal intricacies of running a company. We learned from our mistakes. 

Now, it's on to a new adventure: brainstorming a better startup idea and starting all over again. I don't wanna giveup on my startup dream. I believe someday I'll have a brilliant startup and It will be succesfull.

TL;DR (Generated by ChatGPT): A group of friends started a startup without market research or a clear plan, leading to a messy codebase. Investor struggles and a lack of connections added to the challenges. Initial success with support from friends, but later a decline in customers forced them to shut down.

"hi all, 

i had an interview at a large company for an intern position. I am still in my second year and currently trying to improve on my skills. in the second technical round, the interviewer asked me a couple of programming questions and a few riddles. i absolutely messed up the riddle section, while the programming section was mostly fine(with the exception of swap two variables without using a third entity question, and he asked me to solve this using arithmetic operators. I have never come across this kind of question before). 

my question is, from where do i see and understand such basic coding questions? i have not been able to find these sorts of questions in the prescribed text books from college, and i would like to be able to answer these fundamental questions confidently. also, will buying riddle books and solving them be of any help to me with respect to getting hired or even actually working in the professional domain?

"I am a 2023 graduate from DTU. I received a job offer through college placements. Initially, they informed us to start the job in June, but they delayed it to July, citing the need for training candidates. Despite this, they did not provide any financial support during the training period. Throughout the training, they conducted tests, evaluating our skills. The original date of joining was set for August 7th, but they kept postponing it, instructing us to perform well in the tests they administered. One such test required us to create a medium clone within 48 hours, with only basic Ruby knowledge provided in lectures. Somehow, most of us managed to complete the task. However, despite our efforts, they continued to postpone our joinings.

Finally, I received my joining date in September. Just one month after joining, they abruptly forced us to resign from our positions, stating that the company no longer required our services. They made this decision without evaluating the work we had done.

I am devastated and unsure about what to do next. I put in every effort to secure a decent placement, improving my DSA skills, solving 1000 LeetCode problems, and achieving the status of an expert on Codeforces, a 5-star rating on CodeChef, and a guardian on LeetCode.

"Hello everyone,

I wanted to share my recent interview experience with a startup where I applied for the role of Data Science Engineer. This post serves as a cautionary tale for job seekers.

I was initially connected with a hiring manager for interview scheduling and job role discussions. The first round was scheduled, but the interviewer never showed up despite me being on Google Meet 10 minutes before the scheduled time. This repeated for two weeks, and whenever I tried to contact the hiring manager to inform him, he was never available.

Finally, the first round happened with good feedback, and we proceeded to the second round. However, the same pattern continued for round 2. At one point, the interviewer abruptly ended the call during the interview without any explanation. Again, I had to contact the hiring manager to inquire about the situation, and he casually mentioned that they had an urgent meeting.

Surprisingly, I cleared the second round with positive feedback, and I was told they would schedule an HR round. That's when things took a turn for the worse.

After the second round, two weeks passed with no communication from them. They didn't respond to my calls, messages, or emails. I decided to delete their contacts as this level of unprofessionalism was unacceptable.

- Company Name: Zopper Ltd.
- Location: Noida
- Role Applied For: Data Science Engineer

I hope my experience can serve as a warning for others to be cautious when dealing with Zopper Ltd. during the interview process.

TL;DR: I had a highly unprofessional interview experience with Zopper Ltd. for the role of Data Science Engineer.

I'm a recent 2023 graduate from a tier 3 college, and I'm facing a dilemma regarding my career choices. I didn't have the best placement opportunities at my college, and although I secured a sales job initially, I eventually decided to drop it because it wasn't aligned with my career aspirations.

Recently, I received an offer for my first internship as a Node.js developer in Bangalore. While I'm excited about this opportunity, the internship pays only 10,000 INR, and the cost of living in Bangalore is notoriously high. I'm aware that 10k is insufficient to cover my expenses in the city.

Here's where I need your advice and insights. Should I consider accepting this internship, even if it means dipping into my savings or seeking financial support from family to survive in Bangalore? My reasoning is that having some practical experience on my resume could open doors to better opportunities in the future.

I understand that many of you may have faced similar decisions early in your careers, and I'd greatly appreciate any thoughts, experiences, or advice you can offer. Is this a sensible step, or does it sound like a potentially regrettable decision?

Hey ,

I have been working as a intern in X company when I was hired I tried to find this company on LinkedIn couldn't find then I tried to search profile of my recruiter . I found the profile of the person apparently there was no mention of company X but there was current experience of company Y as a SDE which happens to be a startup. So I asked whereabouts of company X he replied its in early stages. I started to work we worked on company Y product and also out of sudden a new company comes out named Z which he says its his client. Apparently one day CEO of company Y calls me as i logged in to X product so he asked about if he could help I just told him that I work at company X as intern. He says his company has its software developers and no interns . My recruiter got to know that told me not pickup any calls from that number and not input my own number anywhere.

After some days , I worked on product of company Z which also has its owns developer and doesnt out source tech work. So i asked one of its developer which was intern in company Z about my recruiter whereabouts in that company. He told he is a developer in team. and recruiter got to know it and gave me a warning if you have curiosity about company ask me else its a violation of contract and warned me about legal consequences. and also I worked on other products for company A, B also

Also this company gave me no holidays for festives even asked me to work on national holidays. and asks me to do overtime because I couldnt finish my work due to no designs of ui , no system design , no database schemas . I dont know What feature is linked how cause i thing without knowing dataflow anything could go wrong in feature. , He says just assume your own product and build.

&amp;#x200B;

Also when I asked for stipend on 7th of a month quoting ""Its 7th of the month and stipend still not credited"". gave me a warning not to talk to him like this in a sarcastic manner and I have plenty of work to do  else you would be fired.

Is there a thing I can do or is it normal scenario in current tech industry?

Are there any things that lawmakers can do to improve our life?

Can we make a list of them so that we can put them in front of potential candidates? Below are what i could come up with so far

1. **Infrastructure Improvements**: Address encroachments and widen roads, especially considering the traffic woes faced by office-goers.
2. **Public Transport**: Enhance public transport by increasing the frequency of buses and local trains to IT hubs. Additionally, introduce an app by the transport corporation that provides real-time updates on bus locations and schedules.
3. **Regulate Dubious IT Practices**: Implement stringent policies against fake call centers and consultancies that offer fake experience letters. I feel governments have not focused much on these as these might offer some employment opportunities, but they are hurting the reputation of Indian IT and might come back to bite the genuine employees.
4. **Income Tax Slab rate Revisions**: Reevaluate income tax slabs by considering inflation and the cost of living. Although this falls under the central government's jurisdiction, I think we should start this dialogue with local lawmakers and be urge them to come up with their party stand and further discuss this in upcoming parliament elections.

"I was working at this company as a Software Engineer for last 16 months and it was my first job. The money wasn't bad too (around 11-12 LPA in hand, got one small hike since joining). 

Reasons I quit the job -
1. Hated it, it didn't start that bad but since last 3 months my hate has grown a lot for my job. Always been waiting for Fridays, absolutely no motivation to complete tickets on time. Also was getting very intimidated everytime Manager called for a meeting, my performance had gone really down. 
2. Not getting any time to work my side projects. Ever since I joined this company, I have done zero side projects. I just don't have enough energy to do them after tiring days of work. 
3. I don't think I'm learning a lot in this company. I've been given just same techstack again and again for last 16 months, I've asked for some UI work as well a few times from my manager, CTO but they always called me out on my performance instead. 
4. My long term goal is to be self employed developer, so I want to fail now when I'm young (I'm 22 now, I can't afford to not take any risks now and regret in future)

My plan of action -
1. I will make 6-7 side projects I have in mind and deploy them to Google play store in next 2 months (when I'm in notice period)
2. I will write atleast one technical paper in one of the techstacks I was working in this company which I really liked. 

I also believe that completing above 2 tasks will also help in getting another job (If nothing works out) since it'll improve my resume a lot. My long term goal is to make a lot more money than I'm doing currently, not 2X or 3X, but 20X more money and that can only be done if I become really skilled and give myself enough time to try and fail.

Hey everyone. Hope you'll are doing well.

Today I'm reaching out to you in desperate hopes of finding a job. 
I'm a college 2nd year student currently doing my bachelor's in computer applications which i think i would have to drop unfortunately.

My financial situation is not good at all.My father  doesn't work ,we lived on rental income which has been stopped since 2 months because of some cases.Last year in September my mother got kidney failure and been on dialysis since.I can't see her like this anymore. It aches my heart.I have never failed in my academics and professional exams but I think I'm failing in life.

My qualification: I'm a 2nd year college student ,doing bachelor in computer applications.I know basics of java , c , sql , ms office, technical support

Location: Delhi,Remote.

I'm open to all suggestions and will send my resume if required in dms.",In desperate need of a job. In delhi. (Repost),0.86,5,Help,True,2023-10-06 17:50:05,,Daddy-is_Home,1,10,6,17,50,Friday,6.0
"Offer Evaluation: SRIB Should I switch or wait ?

Offer Evaluation: SRIB

2023 Campus grad

Currently I am working in a Company joined in August stable govt. company , and I have an offer of SRIB, Samsung Research Institute Bangalore,

In my current company the work that I am doing is pathetic, no where related to engineering its mostly word file, Excel and testing and the company culture is very bad (Every other day someone gets scold very very bad and for taking leave your manager wants to know every detail and still might not approve (feels like slavery is yet not abolished here) and your manager can ask you to go some outside location on every other day in the scorching heat and it would be around 8-9pm till you return back from the site).


For leaving my current company I would have to pay them 1 Lakh if i leave within a year of joining

Current company has **notice period of 3 months** if i leave after probation of 1 year

And if I join SRIB I would not want to leave before 2 yrs , i.e before end of 2025 because I cant keep switching and If I stay in my current company I can try switching in mid 2024 , but then my notice period will be 3 months(which i believe any company dont wait for 3 months) and I would not have anything to write in my resume because no work is being done here

On the monthly basis SRIB is paying 4-5k less(I dont know about the money growth in SRIB , in my current company its very slow it works on government rules) and I have listened Similar things about SRIB about the type of work(have listened only did not know the exact picture).



Cost of living in my current city(near to home also can go every weekend) is cheap I got everything done under 12k and don't know much about bangalore (very far from home)



My long term goal is to do good work and earn big money 

I don't want to depend on the company and and don't want to feels like being a burdon on the company

It was very matter-of-fact and there was an air of apathy in the room. Finally, I was told to hand over my laptop and ID and was booked a cab. My official last date is 2 months later.

"Hello guys,

I graduated with a degree in Computer Science few months ago. Ever since I graduated, I have felt very very under confident  and under equipped for the job market, especially with it being so competitive. I've always been a decent student, but I never actually tried to learn a programming language expertly. Know a bit of everything and did what was needed for the course and a couple of projects - mostly ML related since it was interesting . Spent most of free time, especially during COVID, doing nothing useful, like playing games and stuff. Looking back on it, I feel and I know that was a big mistake and now I'm behind the curve.  I started looking at all these ""Data Science/Analytics"" hype videos and fell for it and decided that it would be better if I go abroad and properly learn, but it's sooo costly that's it doesn't really make sense for me now to put my parents through that burden. I was preparing and applying to foreign universities last couple of months, but now I'm rethinking. 

Seeing all the posts of the big bros here making 8-10 LPA and some even twice or higher that amount inspires me. I want to change my life and give my parents the life they deserve. They have worked extremely hard to educate and it's high time to start repaying them.

"Please don't misinterpret my post title.. all I want to ask is, ""How to maximise my package when I graduate""

Hi guys,

I'm student in my second year pursuing computer science engineering. I have 2 more years until graduations and have been doing great so far for my resume. I only did coding until the end of my first year, learned web development in my second year, got an internship for 3 months during which I was paid.

My end goal is to get a really high package, I'm in a tier 3 college. Should I focus on web development (learn more frameworks), or should I focus on only data structures, algorithms (leetcode grind) for the next year and start applying for jobs? I can't do both because I also have to manage college and health, but am willing to put in all the necessary effort for the goal of achieving this high package.

I have 2 more years and don't want my learning curve to stagnate over the course. I love programming and want to pursue a career in this field, but I don't want all my effort to lead me to an average package that a tier 3 student gets.

I joined this college because it was convenient to travel to, thinking that I could focus on coding and programming in my house (miss classes and study), and have been doing that. I just want to feeling satisfied when I get placed in the future, and feel like I made the right decision. (I could've gone to a better college but that college would've also been tier 3, so it wouldn't make a big difference. Hence I chose convenience over a slightly better college)

It feels like I've come a long way in these 2 years, but am also slightly panicked about the fact that I'm 50% of the way there. 2 more years and I will be getting placed, I just want to be happy then. That's all I want. ",Next steps for a high package (atleast 20 lpa),0.29,0,College Placements,True,2023-10-05 20:31:58,,Obvious_Bit_4812,6,10,5,20,31,Thursday,0.0

"**Update: Exciting News – I'm Moving to Europe!**

[Taking Bet On My Career](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/16c73yi/taking_a_bet_on_my_career/)

Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to share some exciting news with you all – I've accepted a job offer in Europe ! Many of you have been asking about how I managed to secure this opportunity, **As promised**  I thought I'd give you a quick rundown. But before I dive into the details, here are a few key points to keep in mind:

&amp;#x200B;

**Job Hunt Abroad Can Be Challenging**: Searching for a job abroad can be quite a daunting and time-consuming process. The competition is fierce, and rejection rates are high due to the sheer number of applicants. Also, be prepared to communicate with non-English speaking expats in European countries. While we Indians generally have a great accent and command of English, sometimes interviewers may struggle to understand us.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now, let's get into how I made it happen:**

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Crafting the Perfect CV:**

\- The first step to getting noticed by any company is to beat their Applicant Tracking System (ATS). This often requires fine-tuning your CV.

\- I spent countless hours perfecting my CV, experimenting with different formats, and customizing it for each application.

\- Be ready to fill out lengthy forms and answer questions about your motivation to join the company. You can't use a one-size-fits-all CV, motivation letter, or cover letter. Each job application demands tailored materials.

\- Many candidates drop out because of the time-consuming ATS process.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Dealing with Rejections:**

\- Be mentally prepared for rejection, especially when you're up against thousands of other applicants.

\- Companies typically prefer local candidates unless they can't find the right skills locally. Your chances of being hired are often less than 1%.

\- Think of it as a filtering process where each interview round is like a knockout stage.

\- I've been rejected for various reasons, including being overqualified for a position, not showing the required leadership skills, or not aligning with a company's diversification goals.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. The Power of Networking:**

\- Networking is key. Focus on connecting with people who have a specific target market in mind.

\- To improve my networking game, I automated my LinkedIn outreach (note: I did this within legal limits) to find prospects. Be cautious about LinkedIn scraping to avoid getting your account blocked.

\- I managed to secure two interviews through networking, including one where I referred someone from my previous organization, and they later returned the favor.

\- I also reached out to an ex-HR contact, which led to an introduction to a company HR for a role I was interested in. Having a clear target and networking helped me achieve a 100% success rate in these cases.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Building Personal Connections:**

\- Regardless of the outcome of interviews, focus on creating personal connections.

\- In the past, I've interacted with multiple organizations and got rejected, but I maintained connections with HR and interviewers via LinkedIn.

\- This personal touch led to multiple interview requests from those contacts. It great to see when these people reach out to you how's your son/daughter is doing over Linkedin. So keeping a close connection with people help you a lot

"Long post ahead.

Ater joining accenture in feb 2022 and completing my initial training, I was assigned to a support project with no scope of learning. I was working on customer tickets in production environment and did some monitoring work. I hated this work and badly want to move to actual development.

But in this august 2023, I was moved out from my team, for a new support team for a production instance of another market in our project itself. Remember this production instance is still in development stage and no there are no tickets to work for me.

Initially I was assigned some testing tasks in the new dev and testing environment. After few weeks no one assigned any tasks to me. So I tried to utilize this time and concentrated on upskilling. So haven't attended the daily dev status call also. Also no one asked me to attend. Remember I was moved for new market's support team. Not the dev one. Its been two months and I heard that it will take another 2-3 months for the production to come to live. 

Also I asked for release from the project to my previous team lead, who is currently my supervisor. She told that release is not possible since I was still an ASE and haven't got promotion. She told that release is possible only after the first promotion for freshers as per company policy. It will take another 6-8 months for me to get promotion.

Another person who was also moved for new production support team volunteered himself to do testing tasks for the dev team. He is now insisting me to ask the dev lead to give me tasks or else I will be in trouble.

A small note about the dev team: they are using a low code tool for product development and I have zero interest in learning it.

I learned basics of web dev(react js) and planning to get into development either by switching company or internally.
 
Now what should I do? Should I don't care about the low code development work and continue upskilling? 

Will I get any trouble for doing so in future?

Another option for me is giving resignation and search for another job in web dev role. Notice period will be 3 months. But conidering the current market it will be a huge risk.

I am currently in WFH like most of the people in my team.

Please give your suggestions.",Should I continue the project having no work to do for me? I am clueless and developing the fear of getting blackmarked day by day.,1.0,7,Suggestions,True,2023-10-04 18:00:28,,Idiot-inPerson,3,10,4,18,0,Wednesday,7.0

I had travel plans last weekend, but unfortunately, health issues got in the way. Since I couldn't leave the house, I decided to learn something new. As a backend engineer, I thought it would be interesting to explore the frontend world, so started learning Next.js.

I ended up creating a minimalist coding resource site called [100daysofcode.io](https://www.100daysofcode.io). The idea behind it is to provide a clear path with valuable resources for anyone starting their programming journey in any language. I've kept the website as minimal as possible.

What do you think of the site? Are there any features or resources you'd like to see added in the future? Thanks in advance for your feedback! 😊

"Hi guys

Wanted to share with you all an AI-based interview practice tool that we've developed - [Trupeer.ai](https://Trupeer.ai). We noticed a lot of gaps in the interview prep journey in our circles - especially in coding interviews. While there are coding test platforms like Leetcode, there is no solution that simulates an end-to-end coding interview experience, including all the questioning, follow-ups, thinking on the spot, communication skills, etc.

[Trupeer.ai](https://Trupeer.ai) solves this problem by offering real back-and-forth conversations with an AI interviewer. For example in DSA, the AI interviewer first asks you for a brute force solution, followed by an optimization discussion, and then a cod. The questions are also tailored to the role and interview type, so you get a full breadth of interview experience - you can practice anything like DSA, System Design, Technical interview, Behavioural interview, etc.

At the end of every interview, you get skill level scores and specific feedback on how you can improve your answers and communication skills. 

Do check it out and let us know your feedback. The first trial is completely free.

Cheers!

Anyways, i gave the test and received a call for interview rounds. There were total of 5 interviews and all rounds were elimination rounds. Last wednesday, i had my 5th interview (HR Interview). And i have not heard back ever since then. In between each round, they have taken around 2 days to call me for next round. But this time it has been a week. 

Now since, it is not a start-up so i think they can't just halt the process in between(I guess). Is it normal? How long does it take to actually receive offer or rejection(after 5 rounds?..)? And Can i write a follow up mail now or should i wait till next week?",Follow Up after Interviews,0.78,5,Interviews,True,2023-10-04 11:09:25,,Aromatic_Coconut_231,6,10,4,11,9,Wednesday,6.0
"I graduated from a tier-3 college and received three job offers:

1. DXC Technology (4.5 LPA)
2. A big tech giant (not FAANG) (6.5 LPA)
3. A Bengaluru startup (16 LPA)(12 base, 3ESOPS, 1other)

During my college days, I used to encourage my friends to do competitive programming and data structures and algorithms (DSA), but they were all too busy with their college lives. I knew that if I didn't do DSA or competitive programming, I would end up with no job offer, so I started learning on my own.

I started with GeeksForGeeks (GFG) and then moved on to LeetCode. I wasn't able to do competitive programming on Codeforces, so I gave up on that and focused on DSA on LeetCode. I also did a lot of development projects to get an internship.

In my final year, I got an internship offer from a Bengaluru startup (45K stipend) and later received a pre-placement offer (PPO) from the same startup(16LPA).

Since I was from a tier-3 college, I struggled to find a good teacher. I wanted to explore more in the field of computer science, so I decided to join the big tech giant (6.5 LPA) which was offering an MTech program.

Before joining, I thought that the teachers would be very good and would teach in-depth. However, the reality is that they are the same as tier-3 teachers. They just read the slides and don't go into depth. I was expecting a lot from the teachers, and maybe there was something wrong with me.

Now, I regret declining the startup offer. My main purpose for joining the company was to do an MTech and explore more CS concepts in depth.

"I recently completed my Master of Computer Application at SCSIT (DAVV) in Indore, which is a tier-3 college. The placement opportunities were promising, with several reputable companies visiting for recruitment. However, there was a 60% eligibility criterion, and I had a 59% score in my 10th grade. Consequently, I didn't even get a chance to participate in the initial round of interviews. During that time, my preparation was reasonable, and I possessed knowledge of basic Java, MySQL, Operating Systems, and some networking concepts.

While some companies had no specific requirements, my coding skills were not strong enough. Even if I managed to pass the coding round, I often faced rejection in the subsequent interview rounds. Only 7-8 companies visited with no specific criteria, and I didn't secure a job. Then, the final semester of college began, and I started working on my final year project. I gained valuable experience from that project, and by the end of college, I had a basic understanding of web development.

After graduating, I began working on several projects and regularly applied on both LinkedIn and job posting websites but no response. It has been three months since I graduated, and while many of my friends have secured jobs with 7-8 months of experience on their profiles, I find myself stuck in web development. I've tried applying to some startups, but they aren't willing to offer a salary for the first 6 months. One company offered a starting salary of 8k for the first year, followed by performance-based increments of 15-20k after a 2-year bond.

Currently, my family's financial situation is not good. My father lost his job a year ago and is now working for a low salary at a TV news company. The situation is becoming increasingly challenging day by day, and I'm unsure of what steps to take.

"We hired(no one wanted to hire him except one staff engineer who wanted to give him a chance) a fresher in our backend team. He is 4\* codechef, good in DSA but omfg he can't do anything IRL. He can't even design basic schemas and sadly I was assigned to him as mentor. I've tried my hardest to get most of out of him but now it's increasing my blood pressure anytime he sends me ""Hi sir"" for very simple doubts which are just a google search away. His classmate is also in my team and I enjoy working with him because he just gets things done and comes with solutions when stuck.

Some tips for freshers:

1. Learn how to google before asking your seniors. If you are stuck, find solutions and present to your senior, they'll happily help you in chosing better solution but it's frustrating to provide solution to a problem which you din't even investigate enough.
2. Don't expect them to review your PRs as soon as you're done writing code.
3. Learn to read code not written by you. It sucks at first but no way you'd be able to work properly if you can't read someone else's code. Old code might be bad but that's how code evolves.
4. Some task is unclear or ambiguous? Don't wait for seniors to approach you, just message them that what is unclear and what do you think.
5. Have opinions: Just don't trust your seniors to provide the best LLD, if you think you have better ideas, say them out.
6. Books &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Youtube tutorials for learning something new.

"Let me explain... As an aspiring programmer I had set foot into college with hopes of learning stacks ,building projects and winning in events. Basically I had pretty high hopes for myself to excel in this field.   
Fast forward to now - as a third year student none of those came into reality. I kinda fell into trap due to me failing in a math subject in my first year, which too was an internal exam no idea why I was so dramatic. There began my downfall, a series of bad decisions, negligent circle of people and poor work ethic - the list goes on....all these made me lose my identity about who I was, what I had to do and I ultimately sacrificed my goals.

I was almost into a pseudo-depression. 

Third year was the much needed wake up call to make me realize how behind I am in this marathon.

I finally decided to return back to my old self (at least gradually..) and participate in events. These events made me realize how out of shape I am - for context couldn't even debug a Fibonacci program in a debugging event - which my first year self would have pretty much aced....

Now why am I happy after all these disappointments you ask? Its because it now gives me a feeling that if I'm failing then I'm doing atleast something right. I also refrained from participation in any events as I feared of not winning and how I would be perceived by people if I lost. I'm slowly trying to erase this thought too.   
Although I should have been at a much better place right now, I guess it isn't a bad time to start?

" Hello all,

I'm currently in a bit of a crossroads in my academic and professional journey, and I'd love to hear your thoughts and advice on the path I should take.

I'm a 7th-semester student at a prestigious Tier 1 college in Bengaluru, with placement season already in full swing. I've been passionate about AR/VR/MR (XR) development for the past two years, and I can confidently say that I've honed my skills in this exciting field. In fact, I recently completed an internship at a small startup that focused on virtual and mixed reality, further solidifying my interest and competence in XR development.

Now, as I sit for placements, I'm facing a significant decision. The startup I interned at has offered me a full-time position, but the salary they're offering is relatively low. On the other hand, I have dreams of landing a job with a good company, where the compensation package ranges from 10-14 lakhs per annum. However, my GPA is just above 7.5 out of 10, which might not make me the most competitive candidate for some of these high-paying positions.

My dilemma is this: Should I pursue a traditional software engineering job at a reputed company, potentially earning a higher salary but working on projects that might not align with my passion for XR? Or, should I consider working for a company that may not pay as well but allows me to delve deep into XR development, which I genuinely love?

My resume already boasts a collection of XR projects, but I'm unsure if XR is a stable and profitable tech stack to invest my career in. It's still relatively new, and there are limited companies that specialize in it.

I'm open to advice from experienced professionals, recent graduates, or anyone who has been in a similar situation. What do you think would be the most beneficial path for my long-term career prospects? Your insights would be greatly appreciated as I navigate this critical decision point in my life.

"Hi, I'll try to concisely talk about how I achieved role switch to Software Developer II from Test Engineer II.

2021 Q2 - Join a company as a fresher for Test Engineer Role in 2021, was not aware of distinction between QA, Dev back then. First 8 months did all work. **No personal projects, no self-learning DSA.**

2022 Q1 &amp; Q2 -  Told mentor + management I'm not liking QA work at all and want to shift to dev, was turned down stating team formation, etc. Got depressed, underperforming in every aspect. **1 personal project related to Trading out of interest, no DSA.**

2022 Q3 - Realised current company can't provide it. Started upskilling alongside code reading. I worked on following things :-

* Reading code of current product. Being QA, I had insight of workflow end to end which helped. The aim was to understand enough that I can write it in my resume &amp; defend.
* Started doing neetcode 150, followed its roadmap, any doubts for data structure/algorithms just watched over youtube. All this in Python as I'm familiar with the language.
* Started my own project ideas to enrich resume &amp; get more proficient with python language.
* Read and did few system design questions alongside projects to keep both things inline 

2022 Q4 - Dealt with mental breakdowns with following things :

* Continued code reading, asked doubts, made notes.
* Changed mindset to more positive outlook that things will happen in my favour as long as I am working hard.
* Took a pause for 3 weeks as I was barely sleeping.
* Started giving hints to management I will pursue my goal with/without their support in form of code snippet, personal projects.

2023 Q1 &amp; Q2 - Drafts &amp; drafts of resume! As per my features understanding I kept updating resume current one is v7.

* **Neetcode questions**!!! A lot of them with sincerity and started submitting resumes, interviews (have fucked up few due to lack of practice).
* Continued everyday solving some question which required thinking. Skipped over those which I already could solve.
* Started learning **spring boot + Java** as many JDs I observed were asking for the same and started reading code of Java backend within the team.
* Integrated **system design concepts** in projects / machine coding questions.
* Kept making my requirement clears to current company.

Next steps - Going to continue with same things with same mindset.

* Started solving striver's sheet now as I've solved neetcode questions but revision of those is equally imp for certain data structures like Graph.
* Mock interview with help of friend to identify &amp; improve my questions. Have been supporting my other friends for same.
* Prepare for FAANG level. Just more efforts and question solving!
* Worked on code for 2 different projects for internal company hackathon.
* Valuable projects! Have 2 more in pipeline to wrap up. Will continue with those. Planning to finish in  3-4 months leading to most time for pure DSA questions.

"Hey all! I am back. For those who thought I stopped writing because I got banned, you are an awfully positive person and I love you. I was busy with tax audits and had to stop writing for a while.

**Your total Income will be calculated with:**

1. 100% of your salary(100% as in salary after the normal deductions available for salaried income, like Standard Deduction, HRA
2. 50% of your freelance/contract revenue for the year, provided you do not cross the upper limit for this exemption(75 lakhs as at the time of writing this post). If you earn more than this limit of exemption, you will have to declare your actual profit(Revenue-Expenses).
3. 100% of your other Income(like interest/dividend/capital gain) will be added as it is normally added for calculation of your total income.
4. Deduction as normally available to you will be allowed, if you are opting for old scheme.

With this calculation you will arrive at your Total taxable income and you will be taxed according to the applicable slab rates. Depending on whether you choose old scheme or new scheme.

*Moreover, it does not matter if you had freelance income for X months in a year and salary Income for Y months. Your total income is aggregated at the end of the year.*

## The logic behind this calculation:

The Income tax act allows you to classify your income into various categories(called heads) to allow better and fairer taxability. This means that a person may be entitled to different rates of deductions and taxes depending on the source of Income.

A great example of this principle is applicability of a flat 10% tax on long term capital gain on sale of listed securities. This is done to ensure continuous investments into certain areas(like listed businesses) while also deterring people from investing into other areas( like cryptos) which are heavily taxed.

The government of India wants to foster small businesses and professionals AND hence, the formalities and the tax rate is lower compared to medium and large businesses. This also means that the government only allows your Income from Business or profession to be taxed at a lower rate and not other incomes (like salary). Which is why only freelance/contract income can be shown under 50% benefit and not all of the incomes.

I have a team of 4 people out of which I'm the only one with 8 months of experience, rest are senior developers. This is my first job straight out of college. The thing is, I suck at coding.

But whenever there's a major functionality to be implemented my seniors code it in react/typescript. I have been given these tasks before but since i could not complete them, the seniors started taking them up. And ong, the code they write scares me. They code faster than I can think of a solution and this demotivates me everyday. Everytime they code something and add in the codebase i have to take few hours out and understand everything.

"I'm a Final Year engineering student my branch Electrical but want to pursue career in Web development or Python as I have interest and experience (internship )in those fields. Please help!

Note: I have more than one backlog.

So DeltaX is offering three roles at my college all Non-Tech only thing is that they have no academic bar requirements that's why I'm applying to at least get a job.

Positions offered: 
1. Digital Marketing champion - 8.5 L over 2 years
2. Digital operations analyst - 2.36 L 
3. Business operations analyst - 8.5 L over two years. (Pune/Bangalore)

I'm thinking of applying for the 3rd role as my skill and interest more align with it. As far as I've researched about the role, I will be the person interacting with the clients/business understand their needs and requirements and prove suggestions and solutions and then communicate with the technical team. 

You need to have good communication skills and some technical skills for the role and they company says ""interest in marketing is a plus"" in job requirements section, as I did an Neuromarketing workshop I think it'll benifit me.

What are the reviews about the company?
If any Business analyst/Operations analyst please explain about the role
What the role offers for me?
What does 8.5 L over 2 years mean? What will the CTC breakdown look like?
How should I prepare for the role?
For Aptitude more focus on quant or verbal?
Should I start to learn Power Bi ?
I am quite good at web development especially back end so should I pitch that as well in the interview?
Should I choose Bangalore if I get the offer? I feel I'd be exposed to many more opportunities in Bangalore.

My college's average package is 5.1 L so please don't judge over the package and I have backlogs so even 4L is a good job for me at the moment. I'll be preparing for GRE next year so I'm not looking to stay forever in the company.

"Hi fellow IT professionals,

I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to reach out to this knowledgeable community to seek some advice on a situation I'm currently facing at work.

Recently, my employer has announced their intention to bring all employees back to the office and discontinue the work-from-home option that many of us have been enjoying. While I understand the need for in-person collaboration, this change poses some challenges for me personally, and I'm sure many of you can relate.

I'm looking for guidance on how to negotiate the terms of this return to the office, especially in light of the changing landscape of work in the post-pandemic world. Has anyone successfully negotiated for a flexible or hybrid work arrangement with their employer? If so, what strategies did you use, and what points did you emphasize in your discussions?

I believe it's important for IT professionals to have a voice in these matters, as we've proven that remote work can be effective in our field. I'm hoping to gather some insights, tips, and success stories from those who have been through a similar situation.

  `const currentPageButton = document.querySelectorAll(currentQueryString);`

  `const currentPageButtonInnerText =`

first parameter is the pageLimit that you want to set and second one is the current page that you are on.

So if you are on page 1 and you want to send connects to 10 pages. you will invoke it like thisconnect(10, 1);

I think you guys can build on top of that, like you can probably extract their names and links and sync it to some Database. You can connect using some kind of keyword.

The post was loved by a lot of you. More than 450 people joined and a number of those people have not only come together to work on the [Devta](https://github.com/techrail/devta) project (that was in focus back then), but have also collaborated real well to build the [Bark](https://github.com/techrail/bark) project. It would not have been possible without the amazing inputs and efforts of the members who joined the little Open Source Initiative called Techrail. A total of 4 people from in there have risen to the status of repo maintainers as well.

We are still holding our 9 PM calls almost daily - we talk about the progress of multiple projects that we have, we discuss best practices for each project, what we wanna do (and why) in coming days and a lot about tech in general. This daily call has helped us a *lot* in moving at a much faster pace. In addition, we also hold a live coding session once a week (usually on Saturdays) where we code together to fix a set of issues to push the projects further. It is because of this working pattern that we have been able to push the **Bark** project to its release within just 20 days. Please allow me to briefly introduce both the projects:

1. [**Bark**](https://github.com/techrail/bark) is a small tool that allows you to send log statements to a PostgreSQL database rather than a logfile. It is supposed to be a stepping stone between logfile and the ""Terabyte-scale, enterprise-ready APM and Log Aggregation and Analytics platforms"" (yes, that is a mouthful) which are a bit difficult to setup and operate. It is far from being feature-rich but it is stable, is high-performance and does what it says.
2. [**Devta**](https://devta.techrail.in) is an frontend-only web application which offers a set of small, handy tools useful to developers that we use in our day-to-day development workflows.

Now, September is ending and October is about to begin. And that means that [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is around the corner. In case you're unaware, the [registration](https://hacktoberfest.com/auth/) for it is open. Hacktoberfest allows you to add a star to your profile which is well-recognized around the world for being a quality event. For anyone who is willing to improve their job profile, especially freshers, Hacktoberfest presents a great opportunity

We are putting up both Bark and Devta up for participation in Hacktoberfest (we have tagged both repositories for the same). We have 3 maintainers for each project; both other maintainers were added as maintainers because of their involvement with the projects. We would love if you people would be ready to join our journey to [make something useful in the open source space](https://techrail.in). We have multiple projects which we would love to have more contribution and brainstorming on. We would love to have you on [GitHub](https://github.com/techrail) as well as [Discord](https://discord.gg/aKkWFghPrV).

Now, just in case you do not want to join *our community* but still want to participate in Hacktoberfest, you should head over to their website and register as soon as possible (registration closes on September 30th). Then go to GitHub and search for [repositories that have been tagged with Hacktoberfest topic](https://github.com/topics/hacktoberfest).

"Okay so recently I had applied for a fresher role in an MNC. I got through the first round and now for the second round they are taking cognitive coding assessments physically. They provided a survey form in the first half of this month and gave us options to choose the date and location. Naturally (and I hope not only me) chose a location nearest to my city since none of the options available had the my city name on it. So obviously I now need to travel.

After about 20 days, I didn't get any kind of confirmation regarding the date and location I had chosen. I even sent a mail to the recruiting team or ""campus recruitment"" asking about the confirmation but no response. My date of assessment was coming near maybe a week was left so decided to book the tickets anyway since who knows tickets might be available later on. Even booked a hotel for accomodation.

Yesterday, I got an email. The mail had my admit card on it and the date was not the one I opted for. Instead it's on 30 September at 9 AM. Instantly I sent an email about this even sent proof of my form submitted and my admit card. Went to the site, raised a ticket. 

Now at present, no response to the mail sent and the ticket which I had raised has been closed showing that the issue is solved. The issue was infact not solved when I checked on the site and had no response to my queries.

Is this kind of harrassment normal? Should I get used to this?

It's not just me, I was lucky to get a flight ticket so close to the date. What if there's someone else like me and can't go because of their stupid ass?

"Hello fellow devs,

I'd like to share our startup story with you today, and it comes with mixed emotions as we bid farewell to our very first venture. (TL;DR at the bottom)

Me and my 5 friends (5 from B.Tech. and 1 from B.Tech + LLB) had a brilliant idea. However, we made our fair share of rookie mistakes right from the start. 

Our very first (And the biggest) mistake was that we didn't do any sort of market research. We just came to the conclusion that if we think people need this then people actually need this.... 

Our second mistakle: Didn't plan anything.  We coded away without a clear plan in mind. The result? An absolute mess, 5 noob coders with vastly different coding styles and no professionalism. Oh god the code base was garbage. We all agreed it was shiiit. We realized our mistake and began again, this time with a better plan, resulting in a codebase that, while not perfect, was at least serviceable. It took us a year and a half to get to this point. 

Finally, when we got the tech resolved we started searching for the investers. It's extremely hard to even get a chance to talk to the investors when you are 19yo second year studfent from a tier 3 college. Those interested in investing were demanding a staggering 75% stake in our company – an offer we couldn't accept.

We got tired of investor hunting and thought let's bootstrap it (Turns out it was a good idea in the end). We pooled our resources, registered the company, purchased a domain, and launched the website. 

Third mistake: We thought an investor only brings money to the company. But NO!!! they also bring connection and experience, I regularly think it might have been different if we had an investor with industry connection and industry experience.

Initially, we experienced some success, likely due to the support of our family, college friends, and teachers. However, our earnings were far from substantial, and it took us eight months to break even. 

Unfortunately, things took a turn for the worse after eight to nine months. Our customer base dwindled, returning customers became scarce, and new customers from ads barely stuck around. We were barely breaking even and heading downhill fast. 

Last Sunday, we held a final meeting and collectively decided to shut down the company. Starting on Monday, we began the process of winding down our services: we surrendered the domain, deleted the database, took down the hosting, archived the GitHub repository, and closed our mailing service account. We also initiated the cancellation of our GST registration. While the technical aspects are sorted out, there's still some legal work to complete. As I write this, I've just closed the last chapter by shutting down our mailing service account. Now, I'm pondering what's next.

Because we kept the company bootstrapped we have zero debt, and no pressure from any investor.

I have a job, so I'm not unemployed, but our startup used to be the driving force that motivated me to return home early from the office and continue working in the evening. Now, my evenings will be empty. 

Nonetheless, I'm grateful for this experience. We learned a great deal, not only about technology but also about the legal intricacies of running a company. We learned from our mistakes. 

Now, it's on to a new adventure: brainstorming a better startup idea and starting all over again. I don't wanna giveup on my startup dream. I believe someday I'll have a brilliant startup and It will be succesfull.

TL;DR (Generated by ChatGPT): A group of friends started a startup without market research or a clear plan, leading to a messy codebase. Investor struggles and a lack of connections added to the challenges. Initial success with support from friends, but later a decline in customers forced them to shut down. They learned valuable lessons and now plan to start a new venture, undeterred by the past.

my question is, from where do i see and understand such basic coding questions? i have not been able to find these sorts of questions in the prescribed text books from college, and i would like to be able to answer these fundamental questions confidently. also, will buying riddle books and solving them be of any help to me with respect to getting hired or even actually working in the professional domain?

"I am a 2023 graduate from DTU. I received a job offer through college placements. Initially, they informed us to start the job in June, but they delayed it to July, citing the need for training candidates. Despite this, they did not provide any financial support during the training period. Throughout the training, they conducted tests, evaluating our skills. The original date of joining was set for August 7th, but they kept postponing it, instructing us to perform well in the tests they administered. One such test required us to create a medium clone within 48 hours, with only basic Ruby knowledge provided in lectures. Somehow, most of us managed to complete the task. However, despite our efforts, they continued to postpone our joinings.

Finally, I received my joining date in September. Just one month after joining, they abruptly forced us to resign from our positions, stating that the company no longer required our services. They made this decision without evaluating the work we had done.

I am devastated and unsure about what to do next.

"Hello everyone,

I wanted to share my recent interview experience with a startup where I applied for the role of Data Science Engineer. This post serves as a cautionary tale for job seekers.

I was initially connected with a hiring manager for interview scheduling and job role discussions. The first round was scheduled, but the interviewer never showed up despite me being on Google Meet 10 minutes before the scheduled time. This repeated for two weeks, and whenever I tried to contact the hiring manager to inform him, he was never available.

Finally, the first round happened with good feedback, and we proceeded to the second round. However, the same pattern continued for round 2. At one point, the interviewer abruptly ended the call during the interview without any explanation. Again, I had to contact the hiring manager to inquire about the situation, and he casually mentioned that they had an urgent meeting.

Surprisingly, I cleared the second round with positive feedback, and I was told they would schedule an HR round. That's when things took a turn for the worse.

After the second round, two weeks passed with no communication from them. They didn't respond to my calls, messages, or emails. I decided to delete their contacts as this level of unprofessionalism was unacceptable.

- Company Name: Zopper Ltd.
- Location: Noida
- Role Applied For: Data Science Engineer

I hope my experience can serve as a warning for others to be cautious when dealing with Zopper Ltd. during the interview process.

" Hello members! I am currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering, with plans to graduate in 2024. Placements have commenced, and I initially focused more on preparing for higher studies than for job placements. However, my plans have shifted, and I am now considering working for two years while studying for the GRE on the side. Many companies are visiting my campus, although not as many as last year. My main interests lie in Data Analytics and the field of ML, and I'm not particularly inclined towards software development.

Recently, I received an interview opportunity from a startup through a referral from my mom. They are in need of someone with AI/ML skills for their team. The HR informed me that I would need to work unpaid for 2 months, with compensation to be discussed based on performance (including a 6-month internship and the possibility of a full-time position). The role offers the flexibility of full-time remote work. The compensation discussed was 4 LPA, which is typical for freshers.

My question is, is a work-from-home job with a monthly stipend of 30k a good opportunity? I have materialistic aspirations and various things I'd like to acquire (a PC, mobile, bike, etc.). While campus placements are ongoing, most of the roles available are for software development, but I am applying to all opportunities (considering the challenging job market this year). The competition is fierce in my college, and I haven't prepared extensively for data structures. Should I seriously consider this work-from-home job or wait for more suitable placements? There are companies offering average CTCs ranging from 6 to 15 LPA. I am uncertain about passing an interview since my preparation hasn't been extensive, although I am currently studying concepts like OOPs, DBMS, and OS.

By the way, I am more comfortable coding in Python and not so proficient in C, C++, or Java. Some companies have coding tests specifically focused on C, C++, or Java, which I find challenging.

"Hey Reddit community,

I wanted to share my recent experience working at an early stage startup. It's a story filled with ups and downs, but mostly downs, and I thought it might be helpful for others who are considering similar opportunities or dealing with difficult workplace situations.

I recently joined this startup, even though I had a better offer elsewhere, because it was a remote position. However, within a week, things started to take a turn for the worse. The founder, who was also my reporting manager, began to expect an unrealistic amount of work to be completed in a single day, with no proper knowledge transfer, code documentation, or feasible resources.

When I tried to explain the limitations of the libraries we were using and asked for guidance, I was met with disappointment and rude behavior. Seeking help from senior developers resulted in them labeling me as incompetent. It became clear that I was being isolated from the rest of the team and not allowed to take leaves, not even on public holidays that were made optional.

The situation escalated when the project timeline was shortened without warning, and I was berated for taking a previously approved leave. Eventually, they put me on a Performance Improvement and asked me to work for an additional 15 days, but at 50% of my already reduced salary.

The HR department, at first, seemed supportive but later revealed their true colors. During a final call with HR and the founder, I tried to negotiate for what I believed I deserved, but the founder abruptly told me to keep my code. Frustrated and disheartened, I ended the call, this now is used by HR to say I was behaving unprofessionally.

As of now, they still haven't paid me the remaining amount I'm owed, but I'm determined to move on from this experience. I wish I could name and shame the organization and its founder, who preaches professionalism and punctuality but behaves unprofessionally and is, in my opinion, questionable in their business practices.

This experience has taught me the importance of thorough research before joining any organization, especially startups, and the value of a supportive and respectful work environment. Please be cautious when considering similar opportunities and remember that professionalism goes both ways.",My Experience at an Early Stage Startup,0.95,48,Company Review,True,2023-10-07 19:54:22,,ktrrapukutumb,9,10,7,19,54,Saturday,51.0
"A bit of context ,  couple months back I started my journey to learn more about computers and shared my first project here which got great reaction. 

One of the comment suggestion was to use linux which I did and oh boy it has been amazing.

Bought a second hand L490 ThinkPad, installed linux mint and one months in , I do not even open the file manager GUI.

Setting up alias for doing routine task like printing , opening file using fuzzyfinder `xdg-open $(fzf)` , etc.

Installing packages is such a breeze (unless you want the latest version of that package. For example apt give upto only 0.6 version of neovim. Here other things like flatpak comes handy).

And using vim (both for quick edit and using vim plugin in vscode for react) has been amazing.

Workspace feature is also amazing , now I do not feel claustrophobic with my 14 inch laptop screen.

Thanks to that person who suggested me to use linux.",Absolutely Loving linux and vim,0.89,44,General,True,2023-10-07 15:52:25,,sahil111111,22,10,7,15,52,Saturday,49.0
"A company I interviewed at has my following data:

5.  Form 16 of Last company

Not my fault, because they were asking questions out of my league and I am 100% sure HR doctored my resume and presented me as much experienced guy. But I tried my best. They butchered me. And as expected I wasn't selected. HR assures me she would set up another client interview. But nothing happened since then and I haven't heard from her since then.

"Hello, dear devs of this community, I'm writing this post to get your reviews on this company whether it is fake or not. So the thing is I got one mail from my college mail id about the company named ""the skillians"" who is providing pay after placement opportunity. As I'm currently looking for a job, I filled out the Google form in the mail.

After they contacted me on call. trying to lure me into their company's placement program which is 5k registration fees and if they failed to provide a 10.5lpa job, this amount is refundable
Then they send me the company's brochure, website link, course structure, and their previous alumni's linkedin profiles on WhatsApp.I told all this to my friend, he asked me to tell them to send all this on mail from their company's mail id and they even sent that mentioning all that they told on call.

I reached out to some of their alumni on LinkedIn asking them about the company and they all told well about the company. 
But the thing is I doubted their profiles because 

1) none of their alumni's are in low or middle level companies. One was in apple, other in Netflix and one in nagarro. 
2) even the way of responding to all my texts were all same like - Hi &lt;my name&gt; , and writing.

"To all the fellow developers of the sub, I work as a Software Engineer at an early level startup and I have been here for about 9 months now, coming from a WITCH company, I am used to developing stuff at a relatively slower pace, and here things are really very fast paced.

I have a little less than 2.5 years of experience in this field and I haven't felt this exhausted ever.

I personally work around 15 hours a day so that I can try and complete the feature in the 2-3 days window, and this is not a one time thing, this has been happening literally every sprint.

"I'm an American (of Indian descent) who is contemplating moving to Bangalore for a few years. As a bit of background, I was born and raised in America, don't speak any Indian languages (just broken Bengali). I currently work at large tech company and have lived in the bay for over a decade. My wife is also an American (of Indian descent) who speaks Telugu fluently and knows a little bit of Hindi. She works as a doctor. The main reason we want to move is all of our extended family live in India so we want to be closer to them. Our plan would be to move back to the US when our daughter hits school age.

3. How does interviewing at tier 1 companies compare? Is it harder to get a role at FAANG in India because there is more competition in India?
4. Any tips for how to avoid long commutes in Bangalore? Do you just find a flat near your company and pray that they don't move offices? Is it possible to get to work using the metro?
5. Can I get by without driving? I don't think I could handle the traffic in Bangalore. Can I get by with Uber/Ola/metro or a driver?

"I was working at this company as a Software Engineer for last 16 months and it was my first job. The money wasn't bad too (around 11-12 LPA in hand, got one small hike since joining). 

Reasons I quit the job -
1. Hated it, it didn't start that bad but since last 3 months my hate has grown a lot for my job. Always been waiting for Fridays, absolutely no motivation to complete tickets on time. Also was getting very intimidated everytime Manager called for a meeting, my performance had gone really down. 
2. Not getting any time to work my side projects. Ever since I joined this company, I have done zero side projects. I just don't have enough energy to do them after tiring days of work. 
3. I don't think I'm learning a lot in this company. I've been given just same techstack again and again for last 16 months, I've asked for some UI work as well a few times from my manager, CTO but they always called me out on my performance instead. 
4. My long term goal is to be self employed developer, so I want to fail now when I'm young (I'm 22 now, I can't afford to not take any risks now and regret in future)

My plan of action -
1. I will make 6-7 side projects I have in mind and deploy them to Google play store in next 2 months (when I'm in notice period)
2. I will write atleast one technical paper in one of the techstacks I was working in this company which I really liked. 

I also believe that completing above 2 tasks will also help in getting another job (If nothing works out) since it'll improve my resume a lot. My long term goal is to make a lot more money than I'm doing currently, not 2X or 3X, but 20X more money and that can only be done if I become really skilled and give myself enough time to try and fail.

I am very **VERY** confused. As I like working and development stuff. I want to switch to a new Job.

But, It is also true that the market is very down.

The opportunities that the GATE examination opens are very exciting as well. MTech from a Tier 1 institute, top quality education, great exposure, placements and all of that.

But I am afraid if I fail to clear the exam.

If I choose to prepare it will take the whole of 2024. My friend makes a case that even if I don't like preparing, whatever I would have learned at that point, will help me crack a job interview.

At one moment, I get excited about the gate examination, at another moment I get excited about a new Job and afraid of the Gate examination.

"I'm an sre/dev on with over 3.5 years of experience. I was working on same tech stack for past 3.2 years. 

About 3 months back, all of a sudden I was thrown into a new tech stack. I had no knowledge about it. Had to begin from bottom and I was expected to deliver every sprint. What can I say, I started my career at WITCH.

About 1.5 months into project and I was paired up with 1 other dev who was expert in the tech stack. Somehow, me the experienced dev gave me all manual work and she used to do the actual dev work.

She would give me work and she would go talk with seniors about the requirement. I wasn't informed about various things. She was a little rude too. I would just complete work and send back to her.

Since she was taking care of things other than manual and annoying work, I didn't get much implementation work. I was assigned a new task and I needed her help to finish it.

1 day before submission, she tells in status call that I know everything and she won't be available to help as she's on leave. She threw me under the bus. I was shocked. She even shouted saying it's simple while it wasn't and there were soo many things to do.

Now, I have done how much ever I could do. I have decided to update in status call that I needed her assistance to complete. There is soo much pressure to deliver build by tomorrow evening. I had to vent it. 

I'm serving my notice period 80 days left. The pressure and toxicity was too much for me to handle, so I decided to look for other opportunities.

"Front-end developer, 4yrs exp. I've been on notice period for 3 weeks (WITCH). I was on bench only before so HR asked me to resign and cut the notice period short from 3 months to 4 weeks. After resigning I got in touch with a couple of folks in higher positions (ex managers with whom I have a good relationship) within the company to see if I can get any project allocation. Nothing for 3 weeks.

Even though I had not started preparing or applying for interviews outside, I was kinda okay with it, as I have decent amount of savings and don't have any large financial commitments. Also due to some issues in personal life, I was looking forward to taking a little break and mentally prepared myself for taking a short vacation (booked a trip even) and then the whole process of being jobless, upskilling and interviews and all. 

Fast forward to my second last working day I get a call for a project in a completely new technology, something not exactly related to my field of interest. They said so and so person (one of my ex manager) reached out to us and on basis of his recommendation we are willing to onboard you and train you on the new tech stack. Since there wasn't a lot of time left I had to make the decision immediately and withdraw  my resignation, which I did eventually even before I had some time to properly think things through.

Since it's not exactly UI development, I'm not sure what to make of this. Is staying back the right call? Or should I still go ahead and quit, take some time off to upskill in React and MERN probably and then look for job somewhere else?

Third came the coding round where he gave a question of vanilla js which I did correctly but in the next question I was getting the output but it was a little different than what It was supposed to be so it took me 10-15 minutes to solve that question but after I solved the question i go back to the Teams app and see that he's already left the meeting without saying anything.

Hey everyone. Hope you'll are doing well.

Today I'm reaching out to you in desperate hopes of finding a job. 
I'm a college 2nd year student currently doing my bachelor's in computer applications which i think i would have to drop unfortunately.

My financial situation is not good at all.My father  doesn't work ,we lived on rental income which has been stopped since 2 months because of some cases.Last year in September my mother got kidney failure and been on dialysis since.I can't see her like this anymore. It aches my heart.I have never failed in my academics and professional exams but I think I'm failing in life.

My qualification: I'm a 2nd year college student ,doing bachelor in computer applications.I know basics of java , c , sql , ms office, technical support

"I recently stumbled upon Github's dmca repo, where they document all the dmca (copyright infringement) notices received by them.

I was suprised to find that the company that has sent by far the most DMCA takedown notices on Github is – Nykaa! They've made more than 130 DMCA requests in the last two years. 

Why is Nykaa, of all places, sending so many takedown notices on Github? Thanks to Github making the content of dmca notices public, I scrolled through some of the repos that received notices from Nykaa.

Turns out, as part of a coding assignment for an online fullstack development course offered by a Bangalore based ed-tech firm, their students have to build a clone of Nykaa frontend and push the code to Github. Dozens of students build and publish these assignments regularly on Github.

Nykaa, for reasons only they can explain, deem these demo projects to be dmca-takedown-notice-worthy. So every month Nykaa sends dozens of takedown notices to every student-made assignment of Nykaa's frontend on Github.

&amp;#x200B;

Github has a well-documented dmca policy page with guidelines on fair use considerations for dmca notices. Going as far as asking to state in the notice if Fair use has been taken into consideration.

Surely all these repos fall under fair use protection? I don’t understand the small-mindedness of Nykaa in sending notices for such trivial things.

&amp;#x200B;

And Nykaa is not the only Indian company doing this. Amongst others, Paytm is not too far behind with 60+ dmca requests and Meesho with 40+ for very similar takedown reasons. As per the dmca data on Github, the same third-party agency handles all the dmca notices for these 3 companies (plus a few more Indian companies)

It is very common to make clones of well-known websites for frontend development courses and job interviews. (Search Github for ""instagram clone"" or ""youtube clone"")

I don't understand why Nykaa is so petty?

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I published a copy of this post on my newsletter and Github under a repo named ""NYKAA CLONE"", I hope this will bring their attention to this post by triggering some dmca alarm somewhere in their system.

" I'm looking for a monitor that meets the following criteria:

* USB-C or Thunderbolt connectivity
* 1440p resolution (not a hard constraint)
* Refresh rate greater than 144hz (mandatory)
* Budget under 40k INR (preferably under 30k INR)

I want to connect my office laptop and gaming laptop to the same display, and I would like to be able to use the same gaming mouse and keyboard on both laptops by just switching the input on the monitor.

**Laptop details:**

* Office laptop: Dell Latitude 5430 Laptop with i5-1145G7 vPro, Integrated Intel Iris Xe Graphics, Thunderbolt. Laptop charges via USB-C PD (65W).
* Gaming laptop: Lenovo Ideapad Gaming 3 with (AMD Ryzen 5 5600H/8GB/512GB SSD/4GB NVIDIA GTX 1650/120Hz). It has a USB-C port, but not Thunderbolt. I believe that this USB-C port will only output from integrated AMD graphics at 60hz and not from GTX1650.

**Questions:**

* Is it possible to use the same gaming mouse and keyboard on both laptops by just switching the input on the monitor?
* If so, what features should I look for in a monitor to support this?
* Can you recommend any specific monitors that meet all of my criteria?

**Use case:**

* Office: Heavy Google Sheet usage, extremely large spreadsheets, PowerBI dashboards, SQL, and Python (Analytics)
* Gaming: Mainly esports titles, with occasional playtime in singleplayer/coop

**I would appreciate any suggestions for monitors that meet my requirements. I am also interested in hearing from anyone who has experience using a single monitor with multiple laptops, and whether or not they are able to use the same gaming mouse and keyboard on both laptops.**

"**Update: Exciting News – I'm Moving to Europe!**

[Taking Bet On My Career](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/16c73yi/taking_a_bet_on_my_career/)

Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to share some exciting news with you all – I've accepted a job offer in Europe ! Many of you have been asking about how I managed to secure this opportunity, **As promised**  I thought I'd give you a quick rundown. But before I dive into the details, here are a few key points to keep in mind:

&amp;#x200B;

**Job Hunt Abroad Can Be Challenging**: Searching for a job abroad can be quite a daunting and time-consuming process. The competition is fierce, and rejection rates are high due to the sheer number of applicants. Also, be prepared to communicate with non-English speaking expats in European countries. While we Indians generally have a great accent and command of English, sometimes interviewers may struggle to understand us.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now, let's get into how I made it happen:**

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Crafting the Perfect CV:**

\- The first step to getting noticed by any company is to beat their Applicant Tracking System (ATS). This often requires fine-tuning your CV.

\- I spent countless hours perfecting my CV, experimenting with different formats, and customizing it for each application.

\- Be ready to fill out lengthy forms and answer questions about your motivation to join the company. You can't use a one-size-fits-all CV, motivation letter, or cover letter. Each job application demands tailored materials.

\- Many candidates drop out because of the time-consuming ATS process.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Dealing with Rejections:**

\- Be mentally prepared for rejection, especially when you're up against thousands of other applicants.

\- Companies typically prefer local candidates unless they can't find the right skills locally. Your chances of being hired are often less than 1%.

\- Think of it as a filtering process where each interview round is like a knockout stage.

\- I've been rejected for various reasons, including being overqualified for a position, not showing the required leadership skills, or not aligning with a company's diversification goals.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. The Power of Networking:**

\- Networking is key. Focus on connecting with people who have a specific target market in mind.

\- To improve my networking game, I automated my LinkedIn outreach (note: I did this within legal limits) to find prospects. Be cautious about LinkedIn scraping to avoid getting your account blocked.

\- I managed to secure two interviews through networking, including one where I referred someone from my previous organization, and they later returned the favor.

\- I also reached out to an ex-HR contact, which led to an introduction to a company HR for a role I was interested in. Having a clear target and networking helped me achieve a 100% success rate in these cases.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Building Personal Connections:**

\- Regardless of the outcome of interviews, focus on creating personal connections.

\- In the past, I've interacted with multiple organizations and got rejected, but I maintained connections with HR and interviewers via LinkedIn.

\- This personal touch led to multiple interview requests from those contacts. It great to see when these people reach out to you how's your son/daughter is doing over Linkedin. So keeping a close connection with people help you a lot

"As the title suggests, I find myself in a complete dilemma. I recently completed my B.tech CSE in 2023 with a decent CGPA of 7.5 from a private college. I secured a campus placement in a company with a package of around 5 LPA. Location will be bengaluru or pune ig. However, the company's onboarding process is taking much longer than expected, and I haven't been onboarded yet. Maybe it will be done by this year or by feb 2024. The company sends regular updates so I think the onboarding will be done for sure.

In the meantime, due to the company's delays, I applied and got accepted into an M.Tech CSE at a state government college which is located nearby my house. Also, as far as placement is concerned I don't think they will be having many companies coming there but decent amount will be there. Now, my question is, considering the experienced individuals in this subreddit, what would you all recommend I do? 

Also, I originally planned to discontinue my studies after completing my B.Tech, but the delayed onboarding prompted me to apply for the M.Tech program.","Complete dilemma, What to do?",0.91,27,Suggestions,True,2023-10-04 10:50:23,,LibrarianTiny5,25,10,4,10,50,Wednesday,30.0
"Long post ahead.

Ater joining accenture in feb 2022 and completing my initial training, I was assigned to a support project with no scope of learning. I was working on customer tickets in production environment and did some monitoring work. I hated this work and badly want to move to actual development.

But in this august 2023, I was moved out from my team, for a new support team for a production instance of another market in our project itself. Remember this production instance is still in development stage and no there are no tickets to work for me.

Initially I was assigned some testing tasks in the new dev and testing environment. After few weeks no one assigned any tasks to me. So I tried to utilize this time and concentrated on upskilling. So haven't attended the daily dev status call also. Also no one asked me to attend. Remember I was moved for new market's support team. Not the dev one. Its been two months and I heard that it will take another 2-3 months for the production to come to live. 

Also I asked for release from the project to my previous team lead, who is currently my supervisor. She told that release is not possible since I was still an ASE and haven't got promotion. She told that release is possible only after the first promotion for freshers as per company policy. It will take another 6-8 months for me to get promotion.

Another person who was also moved for new production support team volunteered himself to do testing tasks for the dev team. He is now insisting me to ask the dev lead to give me tasks or else I will be in trouble.

A small note about the dev team: they are using a low code tool for product development and I have zero interest in learning it.

I learned basics of web dev(react js) and planning to get into development either by switching company or internally.
 
Now what should I do? Should I don't care about the low code development work and continue upskilling? 

Will I get any trouble for doing so in future?

Another option for me is giving resignation and search for another job in web dev role. Notice period will be 3 months. But conidering the current market it will be a huge risk.

I am currently in WFH like most of the people in my team.

"Hi guys

Wanted to share with you all an AI-based interview practice tool that we've developed - [Trupeer.ai](https://Trupeer.ai). We noticed a lot of gaps in the interview prep journey in our circles - especially in coding interviews. While there are coding test platforms like Leetcode, there is no solution that simulates an end-to-end coding interview experience, including all the questioning, follow-ups, thinking on the spot, communication skills, etc.

[Trupeer.ai](https://Trupeer.ai) solves this problem by offering real back-and-forth conversations with an AI interviewer. For example in DSA, the AI interviewer first asks you for a brute force solution, followed by an optimization discussion, and then a cod. The questions are also tailored to the role and interview type, so you get a full breadth of interview experience - you can practice anything like DSA, System Design, Technical interview, Behavioural interview, etc.

At the end of every interview, you get skill level scores and specific feedback on how you can improve your answers and communication skills. 

Do check it out and let us know your feedback. The first trial is completely free.

Cheers!

"I graduated from a tier-3 college and received three job offers:

1. DXC Technology (4.5 LPA)
2. A big tech giant (not FAANG) (6.5 LPA)
3. A Bengaluru startup (16 LPA)(12 base, 3ESOPS, 1other)

During my college days, I used to encourage my friends to do competitive programming and data structures and algorithms (DSA), but they were all too busy with their college lives. I knew that if I didn't do DSA or competitive programming, I would end up with no job offer, so I started learning on my own.

I started with GeeksForGeeks (GFG) and then moved on to LeetCode. I wasn't able to do competitive programming on Codeforces, so I gave up on that and focused on DSA on LeetCode. I also did a lot of development projects to get an internship.

In my final year, I got an internship offer from a Bengaluru startup (45K stipend) and later received a pre-placement offer (PPO) from the same startup(16LPA).

Since I was from a tier-3 college, I struggled to find a good teacher. I wanted to explore more in the field of computer science, so I decided to join the big tech giant (6.5 LPA) which was offering an MTech program.

Before joining, I thought that the teachers would be very good and would teach in-depth. However, the reality is that they are the same as tier-3 teachers. They just read the slides and don't go into depth. I was expecting a lot from the teachers, and maybe there was something wrong with me.

Now, I regret declining the startup offer. My main purpose for joining the company was to do an MTech and explore more CS concepts in depth.

"I recently completed my Master of Computer Application at SCSIT (DAVV) in Indore, which is a tier-3 college. The placement opportunities were promising, with several reputable companies visiting for recruitment. However, there was a 60% eligibility criterion, and I had a 59% score in my 10th grade. Consequently, I didn't even get a chance to participate in the initial round of interviews. During that time, my preparation was reasonable, and I possessed knowledge of basic Java, MySQL, Operating Systems, and some networking concepts.

While some companies had no specific requirements, my coding skills were not strong enough. Even if I managed to pass the coding round, I often faced rejection in the subsequent interview rounds. Only 7-8 companies visited with no specific criteria, and I didn't secure a job. Then, the final semester of college began, and I started working on my final year project. I gained valuable experience from that project, and by the end of college, I had a basic understanding of web development.

After graduating, I began working on several projects and regularly applied on both LinkedIn and job posting websites but no response. It has been three months since I graduated, and while many of my friends have secured jobs with 7-8 months of experience on their profiles, I find myself stuck in web development. I've tried applying to some startups, but they aren't willing to offer a salary for the first 6 months. One company offered a starting salary of 8k for the first year, followed by performance-based increments of 15-20k after a 2-year bond.

"We hired(no one wanted to hire him except one staff engineer who wanted to give him a chance) a fresher in our backend team. He is 4\* codechef, good in DSA but omfg he can't do anything IRL. He can't even design basic schemas and sadly I was assigned to him as mentor. I've tried my hardest to get most of out of him but now it's increasing my blood pressure anytime he sends me ""Hi sir"" for very simple doubts which are just a google search away. His classmate is also in my team and I enjoy working with him because he just gets things done and comes with solutions when stuck.

Some tips for freshers:

1. Learn how to google before asking your seniors. If you are stuck, find solutions and present to your senior, they'll happily help you in chosing better solution but it's frustrating to provide solution to a problem which you din't even investigate enough.
2. Don't expect them to review your PRs as soon as you're done writing code.
3. Learn to read code not written by you. It sucks at first but no way you'd be able to work properly if you can't read someone else's code. Old code might be bad but that's how code evolves.
4. Some task is unclear or ambiguous? Don't wait for seniors to approach you, just message them that what is unclear and what do you think.
5. Have opinions: Just don't trust your seniors to provide the best LLD, if you think you have better ideas, say them out.
6. Books &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Youtube tutorials for learning something new.

"Let me explain... As an aspiring programmer I had set foot into college with hopes of learning stacks ,building projects and winning in events. Basically I had pretty high hopes for myself to excel in this field.   
Fast forward to now - as a third year student none of those came into reality. I kinda fell into trap due to me failing in a math subject in my first year, which too was an internal exam no idea why I was so dramatic. There began my downfall, a series of bad decisions, negligent circle of people and poor work ethic - the list goes on....all these made me lose my identity about who I was, what I had to do and I ultimately sacrificed my goals.

I was almost into a pseudo-depression. 

Third year was the much needed wake up call to make me realize how behind I am in this marathon.

I finally decided to return back to my old self (at least gradually..) and participate in events. These events made me realize how out of shape I am - for context couldn't even debug a Fibonacci program in a debugging event - which my first year self would have pretty much aced....

Now why am I happy after all these disappointments you ask? Its because it now gives me a feeling that if I'm failing then I'm doing atleast something right. I also refrained from participation in any events as I feared of not winning and how I would be perceived by people if I lost. I'm slowly trying to erase this thought too.   
Although I should have been at a much better place right now, I guess it isn't a bad time to start?

"Hey guys,

Couple of months back I came across a post on this community which was really motivational about where the op switched after having a 6 month break. It gave me a good idea about the job market and helped me be less scared about the whole affair. It's this one: [https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/149x7dj/details\_walkthrough\_of\_my\_recent\_job\_hunt\_coming/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/149x7dj/details_walkthrough_of_my_recent_job_hunt_coming/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

So, anyway I wanted to make a post about my recent switch too and maybe help someone in the process. 

Details:

* Total experience: 5.5 y (Non-tech 1y3m and Tech 4y2m)
* Old CTC: 6 LPA
* New CTC: 18 LPA (90% fixed, 10% variable)
* Resignation date: 27th May and LWD: 28th August
* Preparation start date: 20th May (I think)

* New company joining date: 13th Sept


Walk through:

I had been working as a QA Engineer for around 4 years(Internship+Permanent Employee). C#, Selenium, MSTest with Hybrid Driven Development Framework. I got tired of my job and felt like I had stagnated. I knew that it was a terrible time to switch but I felt like I had hit a wall in my job and wanted a change. I started applying but most companies would not accept a 3 month notice period. So, I put down my resignation without an offer in hand(Please don't do this, I was going through something in my personal life too and would not suggest someone else to do the same). 

I definitely needed more time to study, I think I wasted 5-6 interviews which could have gone better in the starting two months of my resignation period. Did not get a lot of calls during that time as most companies needed immediate to 15 days joiners. 

In the third month of my resignation period, I got a lot of calls and gave around 35+ rounds of interviews from 15+ companies. 

One of the good things I did was I recorded almost every interview so I could come back later and review the questions that had been asked and prepare them well. Interviewers don't have much time. You need to be crisp and concise in your answers. No one needs to know a 5 minute speech about the difference between interfaces and abstract classes. Just say the two most important points and you're good.

I created accounts on Naukri, Wellfound, Linkedin, Indeed. But I only got calls from Naukri. 

My mistake was that I was not prepared in giving interviews. The way to answer questions, the way to communicate with the interviewer, all of that. And there were so many instances that the questions were being repeated in different interviews but I hadn't prepared well so I lost interviews which could have been salvaged. 

The last week of August was action packed as I gave and cleared almost all the interviews I appeared in. I had specifically mentioned that I was an immediate joined but would later tell the HR that I would join on 15th September basically making the excuse that I need to go to my home town before joining the company. Obviously the company is going to push you to join asap. But if you are confident that you can get counter offers, you should ask them to wait.

In the end I ended up getting offers of 14 LPA (which they increased to 17.7 and later 18 lpa), 16 lpa, 17 lpa. I basically had counter offers due to which the companies ended up increasing their initial offers. The companies will always low-ball you, it's your job to advocate for your self.

I was not expecting my salary to bump up that much. I was hoping for maybe 12 LPA but definitely not 18.

Tips:

* Keep your resume short.
* If applying on Naukri, update your profile everyday
* Practice answering the questions out loud. You could record yourself on a webcam answering questions.
* Record your interviews and review the questions later on.
* Go through most asked questions on google fitting your profile. The interviewers most of the time are looking through the same set of questions.
* Maybe practice a bit of DSA. There's a few list of string related DSA questions that you can check from Google.

Anyway I have been meaning to write this post for a few weeks now and I finally got around to writing it. I am sorry if it's not structured well. I thought I should post it instead of making it perfect. If you have any questions I will be pleased to help.

Things I would do from now on:
1. Give interviews even if I have no intention of switching my company. At the moment I am planning to do it once every quarter. It gives a better understanding of the kind of questions being asked by the companies and also helps you be in practice. 
2. Learn my tech stack in depth BUT learning basics of relevant technologies - breadth instead of depth. Like I am a QA, need to understand in depth of things related to QA but I should also know the basics of networking, sockets, tcp, ssh connections, Java script. It will only help me get a better perspective to work on my profile. 
3. If I am learning something, need to publish articles on medium and lowkey advertise on linkedin. We make the mistake of starting our job search when we are fed up with our current job. But if we are constantly improving ourself and telling the world too(making linkedin articles, publishing on medium) then the opportunity will come to you. Think about it.

"Im a software engineer with about 2 YOE and am currently 27 years old. 
Recently I was experiencing fatigue, body ache and general uneasiness in my stomach.  I heard some of my colleagues had the same issues and that they were diagnosed with vitamin d deficiency. So I decided to get my blood tested before I see a doctor for diagnosis. 

So this diagnostic centre had some common tests grouped as “packages” with a  discount. The vitamin D test I wanted was a part of a package with many more tests I had never heard of. It was not very expensive so I decided to go with that. 

The next day when the results arrived I was shocked to see that there were many more things were off. I had abnormally high cholesterol, high LDL levels, low HDL and the SGPT test which indicates liver function was also high. 

I decided to see a general physician first, his preliminary diagnosis after a scan was that it could be liver infection or liver fibrosis (scaring of liver tissue). He recommended that I see a gastroenterologist immediately as this could be something serious. 

After consultation and some tests I found out I had a fatty liver. This could have led to some thing really serious.

I made this post because I felt like I found this out through some pure luck before it got serious. I would have never know about this if I had not gone for the other tests.  I know there are a lot of people here who work stressful jobs and things like this could just slip through the cracks.

I graduated in 2022 from an IIT (General Engineer Male) and am working as an SDE in a startup (wfh). The pay, work culture, learning, team etc is good. No complaints. I like my job and am optimistic about my growth and career progression in this field. 

But my parents have been pressurizing me to give Govt job exams like UPSC, state services, Assistant Engineer etc. I understand where this is coming from. My parents grew up in a middle class family in the Hindi Heartland (MP, UP etc) and all they have seen are Govt babus who are corrupt, wield influence and respect (Isn't it ironic how our society tends to ""respect"" those who are the most corrupt). I have repeatedly told them that I don't want to work in the Govt because of it's corrupt system, political interference, poor work life balance, limited freedom to work, strict hierarchies and of course limited pay (also reservation in promotions). Also UPSC is such an uncertain, poorly structured exam ki kab jawani ke 5 saal barbaad ho jaenge pata bhi nahi chalega. Why to waste your most productive youth years preparing for a Govt exam? It might be the case in pre 1991 era (limited provate sector opportunities) but now the opportunity cost is just too high to ignore for a GEM IITian.

But somehow, these reasons are not enough to convince them. I know most of you must have been in this exact same situation. How did you go about bringing this mindset shift in your parents?

Edit_1: Ok, since some people are suggesting me to prepare for UPSC alongside my job, I think some context is necessary. I did not sit for placements in my 4th year as I was preparing for UPSC (I was naive that time, probably was in a bubble and got too influenced by society and parents). Gave an attempt, it did not work out. Decided that I cannot do this to myself and let my prime years go to waste (parents were super supportive here). Then I switched to tech industry and got a full time SDE role via LinkedIn. So, UPSC was my past which I am never revisiting again.

Product is not into Market yet, the product being built is somewhere between an MVP and a full fledged product. Plan is to wrap up the product building part within a couple of months, get some early adoption and raise funds to further build the team and product.

Back end is being taken care , but need quick iterations in Frontend and lack of an additional resource is becoming a bottleneck. Current frontend stack is React.

With that context, open to talk to anyone who would be interested in taking a bet with us. No money on the offer ‘yet’. Nobody in the team is doing it for the money ‘at the moment’ but for the future payoff. However, stock options are on the table, as it is only rational to have some incentive to contribute. 

Regarding work - have only one ask : deliver what you commit and reasonably within mutually agreed timelines (+- a couple days would be ok). Work at your own time, remotely, just be proactive in communicating. 

I think this would be more suitable for people who already have a full time job but want to get associated with a team building something on the side.

"I've been working on Python, AWS, Postgres stack for about 2.5 years now.

Python - Pandas, Numpy, boto3, fastapi and psycopg
AWS - S3, AWS cli and Linux configurations automation

DevOps - Ansible and Bash

Primary worked on building data pipelines, APIs and building custom business logic for our product.

I've been relentlessly trying to shift jobs from past 5 months now and could only get 3-4 interview calls which didn't end up with an offer.

Current CTC is about 6.5 LPA and I couldn't even bag a 30% hike. I feel 1 company rejection was due to asking around 10 LPA.

Since work environment was similar to a product based startup, I couldn't just focus on a single tech or job profile. Devops guy left and I had to work on Ansible, bash and AWS setup.

I was initially hired to do Data science work but was primarily involved in building data pipelines using Python, Pandas, and Postgres. Later started working on Devops kind of role and building business logic for our application.

Though I enjoyed the work and working on different things, I feel this is hurting me during job hunt.

I wanted to move to full on Data Engineering roles so I learnt Spark and took Databricks Spark certification and improved my SQL skills. Since I've only worked on building basic pipelines and data was not huge I believed a certification would better my chances.

I'm not entirely sure where I'm going wrong in this Job Search and I'm not receiving interview feedback after the calls.

I've done little from each of the following roles:

Data Engineering
Backend API development
Devops
Python Development 


I have the knack to pick up new things and do it by myself. My code quality and standards is good too. I learnt ansible and Devops by my own when there was no resource at my company. But companies seem to not value my skills. Or I'm doing something horribly wrong which I'm not aware of.

Please guide me on what can I do to improve my chances at getting an offer.

I've been listening to a lot of podcasts and reading some books. I've been contemplating about work, time, relationships, money, and the future of the world in general. By ""future,"" I mean the immediate future, say the next 5-10 years.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of things seem broken right now, as I see it:

\-Work-Life Balance is a struggle.

\-People, in general, are lonely, and as we grow older, we only seem to get lonelier.

\-Forty-year careers are dead. You can't slave away at work and expect to have a family, save, buy a house, and retire. I am talking about the general working class, not the people who make 50lpa. That's a very small percentage.

\-The world of tech, in general, is changing rapidly. We are making so much progress. Boomers are still stuck with their old ideas. Old ideas need to die, and new ideas should replace them. If you're entering your career now, you might be a manager in a few years. The kids and college students alive right now have access to a wealth of information. They are going to run circles around you when they work under you. You'll be too busy putting your kids to sleep. You won't be able to simply keep up. There just won't be enough time.

\-Moving to a new city like Bangalore after college, paying for rent, trying to make ends meet, and ""climbing the ladder"" will not work.

\-If your work location is bound by physical space, most people are doomed. Most people don't live in tier-1 cities. They can't relocate, become IT slaves, make ends meet, send money back home for their parents, find a partner, and get married.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what's the solution?

Work CANNOT be bound by physical space. If you're thinking about starting a company and telling yourself, ""Okay, so Bangalore is imploding because everyone is setting up shop here, I'll go to Kochi  and set up shop."" Kochi will just be Bangalore all over again. Everyone will migrate here for the lucrative jobs. Prices will skyrocket. Traffic will choke you. Employees won't have time for themselves. In essence, we can't have one or two Tier-1 clusters. This won't be viable long term. 

&amp;#x200B;

What is the alternative?

We all work remotely. 

Right now, remote work is limiting.

We lack face-to-face interaction, and there's a lot of nuance that can't be conveyed with text messages and video calls. We also lose that connectedness with peers. A lot of human communication is nonverbal. We weren't meant to live a sedentary lifestyle.

This is where VR and AR will help us augment our reality. They will help us close that communication gap and boost productivity.

&amp;#x200B;

""Bro, what the heck are you talking about? You are delusional.""

You might think all this sounds like fantasy. If I tell you to picture yourself wearing a VR headset for 8 hours a day you'll probably start laughing at the absurdity of it all.

But let me remind you that we as humans are ALREADY spending MORE time in the digital realm than in the real world.

"So, everybody has heard of Layoffs happening and the trend of ""AI will take our jobs"" stuff, right ?

I like many others think that AI is a bubble let me tell you through the case study of Dotcom bubble.

During Dotcom bubble in 2001 when it was at peak, the unemployment rate was similar to what is currently around 8%. 

Now, investors in 1998-99 were looking to safeguard their investment by investing in what they saw future in.

Dotcom was the future then, anything ending with .com was getting money splashed at, rise of the internet meant websites will grow more and more, most of these investors had no knowledge of what a website was.

Companies followed the hype by showing that they were too a part of the whole dotcom thing in their shareholder reports. To ensure their stock values and valuations.

Now, what I am about to say, people might reject it as heresy, but hear me out.

I think the bubble burst was due to one big reason, that is the people got wiser and understood the technology. They understood that there was more marketting spend by these companies than on the actual tech, and again only few companies had made something that would actually matter.

And that's it, boom went the bubble, also one other big factor was the Y2K.

Recently Zoho CEO, Sridhar Vembu also called it out a bubble.

The people saying AI will take our Jobs. Is nothing but paranoia.

The recent recession and lack of foreign investments and clients have led to the layoffs, and people have assumed it to be an AI takeover.

"After a semester, I am going to be graduate. I don't want to be a jobless graduate. To see how things are, I applied to many entry level jobs via LinkedIn. I got rejected by all of them. It maybe because I am not a graduate. But I got really scared. I have a 6 month experience as Business Analyst Intern. But the business analyst role was just a huge title. The job role was pretty basic. I just had to communicate with stakeholders and make sales. I don't know Power BI and Tableau. I don't know anything about programming. I find it difficult. Although if it's needed I will study for it.
 I had thought of doing BA from DU because I wanted to prepare for government exam. But I didn't get the time. So I haven't prepared for that as well. I read on Reddit that most of government bank jobs are really bad. But at this point, I think I don't have the luxury of choice. I can even work for private banks. Please suggest how to go about it. 

I think I have put all of my thoughts here. Please understand what you may and suggest me things. I need help. 

I think I have the following options:
1. Should I prepare for Bank government exam while doing MA from a shitty college? 

2. Should I learn things like Python, Tableau, power BI and search for jobs on LinkedIn?

3. Should I start searching for job opportunities in private banks like hdfc, icici, etc? 

4. Working for a whole other skill like Digital marketing or something that is in demand.

5. Going abroad to do PHD in an arts subject and returning to become professor. ( This option i dont like very much)

* Also I love teaching. I have been a private tutor to a kid and it was fantastic. 

If somebody suggests data analyst, I will also need step by step procedure on how to go on about it. I am willing to do the hardwork. I had programming as subject in 9th and 10th. I studies java. I wasn't best but not the worst. With proper practice and guidance I can do that also. But I think I have limited time left. Also, I have health issues that make slower than average hard worker. 

Ps: I regret not doing Btech. I am doing BA mathematics.

* working on CI/CD pipeline of new components using EKS,K8s, fluxcd, docker and jenkin. Setting up Staging and production env. Booting up AWS db etc. Basically infra related.
* Got my team changed twice in the last 1 year and in both teams, I have been refactoring the codebase, splitting components, and migrating the DB.
* I don't feel I'm surrounded by smart brains. No one thinks of scalability. Our Nodejs/RoR codebase looks very naive. It is just a server for CRUD API calls.
* I feel I lack learnings about Kafka, and elastic cache which are very important things in big tech companies.

Java + spring mvc + REST APIs backend: very much tailored in a way that I have to simply copy or override out of the box files to customise logic using strings, collections and exceptions.

solr search + jdbc + some caching method + db transactions: no need to touch. It is handled out of the box by the product.

JSP and Angular frontends : handled by frontend developers. I have to share the model’s or API respone’s variables to be used.

I thought ab documents maang liya toh ho gaya hai.. After 2 weeks she calls me and tells that I don't have enough experience and the management is looking for someone who has 3YOE. I am asking companies to negotiate with me wrt to salary, but I am being ghosted by them too as I think my prev salary was more than the market standards. Idk what I should do now.

"Tldr is before if the post seems longer.

&amp;#x200B;

I just completed my Post-grad in Computer Science this year but I feel it's been a waste. All this time I struggled with preparing for my exams and couldn't work on my other interests. I was doing several things regularly like programming, cp, grinding through tryhackme rooms and CFTs but exams ruined the flow I had. It was really fine if I would learned something from my uni classes but I couldn't. Professors in dept only care about ML/AI and don't care or know anything about other domains like IT security or web dev. So I didn't get much from my post-grad and I couldn't get enough time to develop skills to get for getting a job. 

Though I will say the only good thing that happened was in my last  semester when I did a 6-month remote internship at an Indian startup  company as a system admin for their single board computer running Linux.  However, I don't feel like it has provided me with much help.

I'm also struggling deciding a single role or path for my career. I wanted to be a pen-tester or ""hacker"" first but realized it's not a role for freshers. Social media make it look like anyone can become ""hacker"" and get IT Security job but in reality they just talking about becoming a script kiddie which is not ""hacking"". 

The next thing I want to become is a Linux System admin but after watching 100s of job listing for this role I find out that either you need years of experience or should have some RedHat certificates that costs around 20k (more or less I don't remember).  And I dont have that much money.

So currently I see two options for me. Either SE or to get into DevOps. For SE jobs I see most of them asks for Java but I'm experienced with C and Python only. Neither I like the oop approach of programming. I don't have any big projects to. I have created many scripts though (in python or bash). I have created a GUI app for last semester project. It an offline password manager. Nothing fancy as I had to learn GUI programming and develop the whole app in a month only by myself (0 contribution form team mates). 

And finally for DevOps, I'm new to this and currently learning about containers. And will take some time before I'm prepared to get a job in role.

&amp;#x200B;

As I recently completed my masters I may have some time in my hand before not having a job stats to ruin my life and confidence. And I have seen and heard that people don't get a job within 2 years after completing their studies then it becomes twice as tough to get a job afterwards. That's why I really need some help and suggestions before I mess things up for myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tldr; Post-grad feels like waste of time as I could have used the time to improve my skills. Now I'm struggling to fix a role for my career as each of the I'm interested in have some hurdles that I don't know how to tackle. Script kiddie disguised as ethical hackers. Hardly any jobs for freshers as system admin and also requires certifications. Don't have projects to get into SE. Currently learning DevOps and as I'm relatively new to it I don't know about any problems I may face in future to get a job in this role. 

I'm very confused and don't want to take a wrong step. I really need some suggestions before it's too late.",I feel like I have wasted these 2 years doing masters.,0.97,45,Help,True,2023-10-27 13:29:16,,Burning_Suspect,42,10,27,13,29,Friday,46.0

"Hello, I am currently in my second semester at Monash University in Australia, pursuing a Computer Science degree with a specialization in Software Engineering and Data Science. I have approximately three more years to complete my bachelor's degree, followed by a one-year professional year. Professional year is just a placement year sponsored fully by my uni which would help me gain some experience in the field to get a head start.

Based on my calculations, I anticipate having around 90 points for PR after finishing my studies (including NAATI and all that BS). However, due to the intense competition in Australia, I most likely wont receive any PR invites . I am now tensing about my future goals. If I have to return with a bachelor's degree, achieving High Distinctions (HDs), along with one year of professional experience through the Monash IBL program, and potentially one to two years of additional work experience from Australia to India, how bad my situation would look like?

EDIT :  I wont be in any debt, so I don't think this was a bad financial decision. 

I am aware that pursuing a master's degree in Australia after bachelors here could potentially increase my points to over 100, making it easier to obtain PR. However, I have learned that recent visa applications from students who have completed their bachelor's degrees in Australia are being rejected. The immigration department often cites concerns that these individuals intend to settle permanently rather than solely for educational purposes.

Hey everyone. Hope you'll are doing well.

Today I'm reaching out to you in desperate hopes of finding a job. 
I'm a college 2nd year student currently doing my bachelor's in computer applications which i think i would have to drop unfortunately.

My financial situation is not good at all.My father  doesn't work ,we lived on rental income which has been stopped since 2 months because of some cases.Last year in September my mother got kidney failure and been on dialysis since.I can't see her like this anymore. It aches my heart.I have never failed in my academics and professional exams but I think I'm failing in life.

My qualification: I'm a 2nd year college student ,doing bachelor in computer applications.I know basics of java , c , sql , ms office, technical support

Location: Delhi,Remote.

I'm open to all job suggestions and will send my resume if required in dms.",In Desperate need of a Job. Financial crisis(repost),0.67,1,Help,True,2023-10-27 17:06:31,,Daddy-is_Home,4,10,27,17,6,Friday,1.0
"I am a drupal developer with 1.5 years of experience now after I was released from this role in a WITCH. I tried my very best to switch from drupal to reactJS/Angular. I also have learnt python and have 2 certification and 4 star batch on HackerRank. 

But now after I rejected all the drupal based project the RMG is forcing me to take a support project in the drupal itself. I have managed to get a drupal based development project. Also I have been unallocated for some time (3 months) now and RMG is telling me dont you have shame taking salary for free and not working ? 

Now I see many people here are highly qualified please suggest me something. I want to learn something new and want to switch. Also I know the current situation of the job market thats why I think it will cause problem for me if I reject any more projects so I have finalized the drupal project as of now.

I am ready to work hard but I am not able to see anything in the future. Just for some background I am an electrical engineering passout 2021 batch.

"So I have switched from an MNC to a startup starting this year, but things are not seemingly going very well here with my manager. This is my 3rd project here already, but my manager has been the same person in all of the projects. To give a little clue, she had taken a break from corporate job many years ago due to child responsibilities and had then switched to school teaching. 2 yrs ago, she again switched back to dear old corporate, but her way of working doesn't actually match to that of a corporate, but kind of a high school teacher. Hope you get the gist. Plus I heard that the appraisals are also not very decent for everyone here, so I'm in kind of a dilemma to either stay here for some more time or jump out. Plus, the unpaid working on weekends has also been shamefully normalised by her, so it's kind of taking a toll on my work life balance every now and then. I have an ailing father to take care of and this job being a wfh is the only good thing about it that I'm able to leverage. Salary is also sort of let than decent, but I take it on my own self to have quoted lesser before joining.

Due to delayed hikes(over 2 years and expecting hike in 2 more moths), I resigned to my position (later I got a good offer). At the time of resignation I informed my manager and HR there is no response from them(3 months notice period). After a month and half my manager messaged me and asked for possible extension of my service and hasn't talked about the hike or retain.
Because he didn't found the suitable candidate for the position.

I clearly communicated that I will serve the notice period, and as I need to join other organisation I can give them at most 5 more days on top of notice. 

Again after 20 days(almost into 2 and half months) HR approached me and asked me if I can write mail that I am revisiting my resignation and can extend date to 15 more days than the committed one, so that they can update on the system.

I literally got shocked and clearly told him that I told my manager that I can spare 5 more days not 15. But HR argued that due to my commitment only they delayed the on boarding of new employee.

I posted all my conversation with screenshots to HR. Then I got to know that my manager is also notice and haven't informed about the details clearly to HR and this week is his last date. Transition is also started to new manager.

Worst thing is my new manager accepted the handover from old manager and had a meeting among the team, and in the call he mentioned that he was not aware I am working on both UI and BE in 2 projects and managing dev team.

I got suspicious about wether old manager informed about my resignation or not, so after call I pinged him and had a discussion and told him that I am on notice will leaving company in 15 days.
He got shocked literally and try to pull the old manager into call.

Now my old manager called me and literally getting anger on me saying that why I informed about my resignation to the new manager.

"I'm a 2022 [B.Tech](https://B.Tech) CSE graduate from a tier 3 college. My initial plan after college was to pursue MS in Canada. So I prepared for GRE and IELTS during my final year in college. I scored a not so good 308/340 in GRE and got 8 bands in IELTS. After which I applied to quite a few top colleges and some average ones. I didn't get an acceptance from any of the top ones. I got two offers from not so good colleges and it didn't seem worth it to take 40L-50L education loan for them as they were not recognized colleges.

One of my biggest regret from college is that I also didn't appear for any campus placements. So I was without a job after I graduated and nothing going for me. Due to my joblessness my parents started nagging me to prepare for Govt. exams like state PSC as my father also cleared the exam as is working as a DC in govt. I gave in as the promises of 'job security', 'less work hours' and 'work life balance' seemed lucrative. I joined a local coaching center and started my preparation. At the same time, I interviewed for a teaching job at a govt. school and got a job as computer teacher which I'm doing till date. I get a salary of 35k in hand which is nothing to complain about. My work hours are 7AM - 1PM with 1hr commute time. After which I go to gym and then coaching and rest of my time self studying.

Now my problem is that after preparing like this for 4 months, I realise that the preparation is going to take anywhere from 1.5y to 3y and I've to memorize so many useless facts just to clear the exam which is not building any skill for me. That's not the issue though, I'm confident in my abilities that once I make a decision I can do whatever it takes to clear the entrance exam. But my interest and passion is in programming. I want to get into the tech industry and work as a software engineer. It was a tough decision and last month I quit my coaching and have started to brush up my skills in python and started solving problems on codewars and leetcode. I've been a full time linux user since college days so I'm pretty good with using the shell and terminal. I am comfortable with C, C++ STL, JavaScript, Python, Shell and shell scripting, git and my raw typing speed is \~80WPM.

"Hello everyone,
I'm a 2022 batch B.E graduate. After college, I joined an Indian organization as a Software Developer. It's a good company and my package is  around 10LPA. In addition to this , I get good benefits and the work culture is not bad.
I'm a part of a team which works with low level C++ code, shell scripts etc. Apart from this I get to participate in many design meetings and also work on some proof of concepts.

While things are going fine for me , I feel that I need to level up. The tech stack I work on right now is not very popular in other organisations and may not get a lot of value.

I'm not sure how to progress in my career.

My initial thought a few months back was to start doing leetcode and system design and try getting into a better organisation with better pay. However I'm not sure if that is what I should focus on considering the job situation right now.

I also thought of preparing for masters abroad but don't know if I would really want to get into that considering the cost.

I get around 10-20 hours of free time each week which gets wasted because I don't know what exactly I should be doing. ( I know I could be doing leetcode, read a book , take a course , or make a project but need a better goal and don't want to randomly do stuff)

I'm looking for suggestions on how do I utilise this time and become better in my career. Looking for suggestions.

"Hey guys,

As the title suggests, I have been trying to wrap my head over this for the past few months now. And it's that time of the year again. I am a software dev (YOE: 2) working in the backend looking for a more techno-management role. Why data science? Because that's somewhat less code-intensive and I have prior project experience. 

Anyhoo, my main priorities right now are investing at the right place where I can get the most exposure in terms of networking and also money. Yes, India has a lot of monetary potential but I want to explore outside the country at the moment. The only reason I'm thinking of Ireland is because of it's 1-year program but am not that sure about the compensation part. Is it decent? How much is the median savings for an entry-level with 2 YOE in the tech industry after taxes and expenditures? How's life in general? What are the exit options?

USA has always been the land of dreams. I visualize it to be THE place for techies who love management too. But the distance from home and also the ongoing unfortunate events like mass shootings and whatnot is bothering me alot. I do not plan to stay back in US if I choose this option though and would like to come back to India depending on the situation. And also, 2-year masters' program. Smh. Ughhh it's so difficult to choose one. 

In dire need of what the community thinks about the two options out of experience. Any other alternatives are also welcome. Thank you.

"Background:

I completed a Bachelors in Automobile Engg from a college in Pune in 2019 and after that, I completed an M.S. in Industrial Engg in the USA in 2020. For about 2.5 years, I worked in the electronics manufacturing industry in the US. I lost my job in March 2023 and had another job offer at the end of June. Back home, my dad was going through treatment for prostate cancer and things were in control until the end of June when he was hospitalized because the cancer had gotten aggressive. Fearing that things may get worse in my absence since I am an only child, I decided to let go of the job offer, sell/give away all my belongings, and move back home (Pune) in July. Now my dad is doing much better but the treatment is still on and he has trouble walking and needs someone to take care of him which my mom cannot do all alone.

I am finding it very difficult to find a job as an Industrial Engineer because that profile is relatively rare in India. Even if I did find a job, it would be in a manufacturing facility with long hours and a long commute which would prevent me from helping my dad at home and frequent visits to the doctor/hospital and that is my first priority right now.

What I want to do is find a job in Pune which is at least hybrid if not remote with decent pay so that I can at least manage to keep my bills rolling while being available to assist my parents when needed. And this only seems possible with a tech job. I have no experience in tech except some very basic Python. I am willing to learn any skill from scratch if it increases my chances of getting a job.

Also, I have an education loan that needs to be paid off which costs me \~45k INR per month in EMI and \~20k INR minimum payments for my credit cards in the US. 

I know I done fucked up real bad and probably could have planned my finances better when I was in the US but I'm just trying to make the best of a bad situation here.

"Hi.
I am a SDE with 5 months experience as full time and 1.2 years experience as an intern at the same company. The work culture is great and the pay is fine too. But a few days ago, a situation arose. I won't say a situation, but something similar.
FYI - I got full time in june and when my director handed me the letter, he told me that I was one of the best interns they had hired and all they could hear were talks of my good work. ""You will be rewarded in the upcoming time also, with the money and other perks as well"" was his wording. Now, a few weeks back, I had my mid year performance evaluation with my manager and senior manager, who again praised my work, technical skills and everything. There was only one point from there side which was time management, which I also think of as a shortcoming of me. 

Before this meeting, my manager had invited me on lunch as I was on a trip to his hometown. There, on lunch he told me that he had recommended me for an increment during mid year evaluation. Mind this that my manager also told me that he gets 25% increment every 6 months. I was very happy that my work showed fruit. But during my evaluation meeting, there was no talk of an increment. So, after a day or two, I assumed that I was not to be given increment and since my manager and I are quite frank, I asked him directly, where did I lack so I can focus on any other shortcomings too. He told me that I did not lack anywhere and if they haven't said anything, they will say it during the time they give us diwali bonus. Again I was happy.

But yesterday only, I got my Diwali bonus from my director. He never said a word about increment. I was not happy, and since my manager was on leave, I thought it won't harm to ask my director only, about what were the factors due to which I could not get the increment. He simply said that there is no such concept of mid year increment in the company and it is given only if they feel the base salary of an individual is pretty low. 

Tbh, just wanted to speak out to someone about how disappointed I was after going through a roller coaster of emotions in some days.

 It might be normal for some people, but since it is my first time, I don't know what to do or how to react.

"Tl;dr : got benched by witch for a better part of a year and now laid off. know basics on both fullstack and data analytics .Need advice on what to do next🙃



I am a 2022 passout who joined one of the Witch from college placement. Things were going good completed their training exam with good precentage and then I came to know why everyone hates witch. I was benched for 6 months with no communication about my billing. I was lazy not knowing what this would cause to my career and doing some basic inhouse certification and some external certification for 6 months.After 6 months they allocated me to a support project which has nothing to do with the technology they trained me in.I was on this project for only 3 months but the project got shutdown. After that i got benched again🤡 . 



Now  I am in Loss of pay(no salary )for staying in bench too long.Even if i apply to other projects roles for billing everyone turning down on me since i was only billed for 3 months and say ""apply for fresher position"". Now my manager ghosts me my Hr ghosts me and my fresher spocs saying she is working on allocating all of us on project be patient (theres almost 100 2022 passouts in loss of pay under her🥲).Now my lop is also ending and will be laid off after that.



Now i don't know what to do . I am currently confused in what to do next  I want to choose a different career path than support projects I know some basic frontend development from college (like html css javascript react) .can build some clones like Amazon and Twitter with it. But i was trained by the company on data analytics like hadoop, apache spark ,hive ,mongo db Google cloud platform (had done the certification) snowflake, informatica, Sql, postgre Sql.



Now my confusion is to choose which career path to upskill myself.  Do i go full stack web development or go data analytics and bigdata. Which path has more opportunities for most career growth. Please give me some advice on this thank you. Sorry for the long read.

[TLDR: Should I start learning web3 stuff and ditch the Android path, please read my 3 questions below(at the bottom) to answer my doubts ]

I am currently a 2nd year student in 3rd semester, in my 1st year I explored a bunch of domains like web development, front-end stuff, cyber security like Metasploit, app development, cloud(Aws)

I decided to stick to app development and learned Flutter and in 4 months of learning and side-by-side project building I landed my first remote internship(India only) and it will end this coming November around the 10th or so, 

I have figured out I don't like the front end at all and now I don't see myself as an app dev because I don't enjoy working on this 

I am thinking of switching to web3 tech stack which has things like working on eth, and Solana blockchains etc., this field piques my interest on a philosophical level which is one my prime motivators for all the actions I take related to my career besides money

Here are my questions (senior people also please bestow me your wisdom) 

1) I learned Flutter which is relatively easy to other frameworks in 4 months and got an internship, is my speed good? I was a commerce student in school with basically no coding knowledge  before college and I have heard you need to adapt fast, do you think this is good enough or I should improve in this area

2) Should I start learning web3 and ditch the app dev path, I am thinking of committing to web3 for these 2 coming years because I will graduate in 2026, and my college has no placement, I have learned solidity for now.

3) If I stick to web3 for a few years and become proficient at it, will it affect the money in my career because by 2 years I will have huge family responsibilities",Wisdom will truly be appreciated,0.89,7,Help,True,2023-10-25 21:30:01,,fake_slim_shady_4u,5,10,25,21,30,Wednesday,8.0

"“Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy has said that youngsters should work 70 hours a week if India wants to compete with economies that have made tremendous progress in the last two to three decades”

First of all, he’s not talking about Infosys or software engineers. Second of all, he’s not talking about corporate success, rather countries’ success.

In my view, he is hitting the bulls eye on what we as a country need to compete with global heavyweights. Do you know what’s common between all IITs regardless of the major you join in? Do you know what’s common in Big 4 work culture? It’s just one thing - Sheer hard work. 

Money is a byproduct and I am absolutely certain that today money will chase the person who is doing hard work. Maybe not in the same sweat shop of a company that you work for, but the money will eventually chase and reach you if you’re in for hard work.

I would blame traditional Indian “officer” mentality for all the abuses that NM received for this fiasco. For some unknown reason, in India, hard work is looked down and people who do less work and get paid more are heroic.

"In 2014, I began a job with a modest salary of 3.3 lakhs per annum. A mere few months later, the company shut its doors, and I found myself jobless. It was a tough period, filled with family pressure and self-doubt.

Yet, I came to believe that this adversity was a test, a preparation for the power and position I might hold in the future.

During these difficult times, I learned to distinguish between true friends and others. Some friends stuck by my side when I needed them the most. There's a significant difference between those who genuinely care and those who don't. One such friend was always there to comfort me, to listen to my worries, and to help me see things in a positive light. I was fortunate to have this person with me.

With this friend's unwavering support and my newfound determination, I decided to prepare for the SSC exam. After two years of hard work and their constant companionship, I successfully passed the exam and worked for four years and went on to start my own business. I grew in confidence and learned to navigate life's challenges.

Finally, I realized that this person was the one chosen by a higher power - my partner, my lady luck. This person was with me when I needed them the most and continues to be my source of strength. Some things and some people are sent by God, but we often miss recognizing them. It's better to see them, to talk to them and cherish their presence. This person is my wife, my lady luck now who even though had a busy schedule still never failed to reply me, take out time to talk to me.

In these difficult times, Its better to talk and release that negative energy that is within you and spread out the positive aura from inside.

I feel this was a mistake because now the manager/CEO thinks i can always complete complex task quickly. I only completed these task quickly because we were approaching a deadline. Now my normal pace feels slower to him.

Right now since i do not have any major feature to work on rather than fixing minor bugs given in tickets, i have been doing the tickets only and completing 3-4 tickets daily. 

As of now i do not have any task assigned to me rather only 1 task for which i need the senior developers help. And 1 other task that requires the admin side to be completed first.

If you want to just read the question I am asking advice on please read the last paragraph.  


# A little background about me- 

I used to love problem solving in my  class 11/12 days. I have heard of coding in my 1st yr but was  completely unaware of the concept of coding so never really liked/ was scared of coding and you know the Indian education system so I tried avoiding it best I could.  


# Post grad scenes -

I passed out in 2020 among peak pandemic , my last sem was affected by pandemic so missed my last sem . After graduating I was looking for jobs and getting increasingly frustated with regular jobs , so I started looking into IT career and coding in general and fell in love with that problem solving nature of coding. I applied for some entry level IT jobs and after failing multiple interviews , I passed one with flying colors and was selected in the company I joined that mid 2021. I had done no internships and my main knowledge about computers were extremely fundamental . I had scoured through the internet went through idk 100hrs of yt tutorials to understand about coding . I started the journey of coding with python.  


# Main topic , advice / request I want from you - 

I am right now in this company for 2.5 years and in the meantime I have done AWS CCP certification and built some personal projects as a hobby , I deal with SQL , informatica , IFS technologies everyday as in support jobs (typical service based company projects) . I have been promoted twice this year due to my excellent performances and I have received Sr Director level appreciation(from client side) for quick problem solving and troubleshooting . I am quite fluent in SQL and Javascript right now , I wanna be a full stack developer( a good one) using MERN stack . I am learning from the Odin project which is an absolute lifesaver honestly .   


These are basically the tech stack I have worked on till now  -   
  

· JavaScript

· HTML

· CSS

· React.js

· Node.js

· MongoDB

· AWS

· IFS App

· ETL (informatica)

· SQL  


Can you please tell me what improvement I can make for myself in my CV to switch to some other company, right now I am getting such appreciation that my manager is reluctant to let me leave this project and I wanna be a dev in future not stuck in support activities. Every where I see in linkedin I see Java Developer is demanded .  My final goal is to work in MAANG/FAANG that will take some time I am not in that level yet.

"Don't know if it's a rant or I'm just a demotivated but I'm lost in this life
I'm 27 year old guy from Gujarat and currently working as a .net developer in IT company. So here's my life story,I failed in 12th science and then took commerce and graduated with bcom! Had a deep interest in programming so started learning it some 5 year ago,started with PHP and learnt some oop concepts and tried my hands on .net(C#) but then this Chinese virus called corona came and fucked me up badly! So I had to took up job as accountant in some msme,some 1.5 year ago I cracked jr .net developer interview and now currently working there. 
I've no complaint with company or coding as everything is going smooth and I'm earning 30k per month and I think that's enough for tier 3 city.

The problem is,I lost my spark! I'm not enjoying anything in life,I thought programming would give me a thrill and it was a thriller experience untill it became repitative! 
Some 5 months ago,during the dark rainy night,when I was depressed and thinking about motive of this life,an idea sparked my mind about starting a youtube channel regarding decoding Hindu religious texts and serve it with our own philosophy and our own understanding! As my understanding about Sanskrit language is quite good so this idea got my attention! I discussed it with one of my friend who has great oratory skill and can be a face of that channel and told him about finding a female face coz the format of that channel requires that! But the problem is he lives in Europe and finding a girl which can act and understand Hindi Language is near to impossible! I've even told him that it's okay if a girl can't understand Hindi as we've an option of dubbing available but he's not able to find anyone! It's been 4 month since I gave him first script but nothing happened since! Yeah I can get any actor to do this job but I don't have that much money! Getting depressed day by day coz I'm so bad at executing anything! This sparkless life has led me to nothing but misery! I'm curious case of imtiyaz Ali's movie! With this kinda situation, I started consulting astrologers out of depression and some psychologist but nothing is happening! Life has just become so repitative that I'm not finding anything good here. Roj utho,nahao,kaam pe jaao,manager ki galiya Khao,Ghar aao,aadha ghanta reels dekho aur so jao! I think this is not the way I should live! I've been single all my life and afraid of marriage coz I have no confidence at all in my self! I curse God everyday for sending me to this earth!

I had no real passion and goal, and I was moving with the tide, until I realized how far behind I am, in terms of salary/growth/wealth perspective compared with my peers. I don't have a good salary even till decent level neither moved up the ladder, as managers kept on ditching me and I was one with loyal servant attitude (like kattappa in Bahubali), lately I realized I am like a tissue paper here. I was shifted between domains/modules/projects throughout my career and at this juncture I am like **Jack of all, king of None.** I am not an underperformer, am good at whatever work assigned to me and very good in building and solving stuff. When I compared myself with laterals, I use to feel how good I am in understanding stuff and implementing them.

I am a deadly combination an Introvert, very sensitive and very emotional.

And I realized I could have addressed my problem then and there and could have fixed rather than giving up, which I didn't realize that will haunt me forever from various angles. I didn't share my inner struggle with anyone hence no one from family or friends had any clue why I won't change the company and why I settled for so less than my caliber.

But fast-forward now with 15 years exp, with above said reasons I am in a phase I have to switch at any cost, to grow personally, financially at least for sake of my kids. I know I may have a limited time or is there enough time for me to grow?

"Hi Guys,
I (24M) currently work in robotics in a MNC, did my graduation in Mechanical Engineering. I currently work in Pune and my office is in a campus with alot of other IT companies. 

Here comes the dilemma, mechanical doesn’t pay well so I am currently preparing for CAT and plan to do MBA from a decent IIM. But after working for almost 2 years going back to school is gonna be difficult. Also I have a lot of friends working in IT who earn well just with bachelors in CS. I wanted to ask you guys if I should switch to software as I’ve seen alot of guys fetching close to 20LPA in few years. Or should I go for MBA from IIM. 

Thing is if I switch to software I’ll not take a hit income wise and will grow steadily. I just wanted to see if MBAs is actually worth it as compared to IT if I can get around 20LPA in a few years. It’s not that I can’t afford the break, I can.

"We have a team of 7 people including two developers (including me), two business associates, two statistical analysits and the manager cum Solutions Architect (manager is also responsible for handling high level architecture). We are considering another person, which the manager has not hired yet.

Since the start of the project, the manager is relying on me for everything. Like every single thing. Even when there is another developer, the manager is not assigning any work. Even when some work is assigned to that another developer, the person is unable to do anything.

One example - the other developer told the manager that he has worked on Git. But, since I knew his attitude, I told him to re-visit some Git concepts, since he was going to ask me anyways, and we need to learn Git. He said to me that he has worked on Git in his previous company. However, the following day, he is asking me how to push the code to Repository. When I confronted him that he clearly told he could handle it, he said "" There may be something new in this project for pushing the code to Repository"". I ignored him, saying that there is nothing new and he can handle the task himself. This is just one example. He even wants me to send him search results for some codes that is new for both of us, even when I am assigned a different task.

I can help him, when I am free, but I am normally not free. And even if my manager knows this attitude of this person, he is neither firing him, nor hiring another associate.

Sometimes, I am free. Other times, I am totally packed, and on top of that , I need to handle this ridiculous non -professional team member. During those times, I feel burnt out so much.

Moreover, the manager wants to get things done as soon as possible, even if it means starting the day early, which is okay, if there is an emergency. But, even when there is no emergency, manager wants that done asap. So, let's say, if I start my day at 9 AM, manager wants me to login early at 8 AM and finish the task, whether there is any emergency of completing that task or not.

"I think a full stack web developer, an android developer and a ios developer are enough to build most of the software in three months like codecademy which is basically text editor running unit test, quora is basically saving an object containing question and answers, pinterest is simply a database with images, flipkart basically an eCommerce website which many have already built as a project for resume. They say, as users grow and scaling is difficult, but I can find many managed cloud services which many not handle millions of concurrent users but atleast they can handle few hundreds, which is the most case other top big companies.

But I also understand that there are big software like AWS, windows, sap, chrome are complex software, which need more developers.

I got this doubt as I started out as freelancer and doing project and as of now are simple static websites. I always thing what If I get a client who wants big software like custom eCommerce or billing software or mock test software? I know how to build they but then this thing pops in to my brain, that I a building a flipkart clone in three months, but flipkart has hundreds of software engineer working on just coding website. Even if they are coding, testing, fixing it professionally even then ten developers should be more than enough. You can find clones of billion dollar companies products on junior developer's resume or 15 hour YouTube tutorials.

**What am I missing?**

Edit: I see many negative answers, I asked a genuine question, maybe I should have posted this in r/NoStupidQuestions.

Edit 2: I agree that the question I asked questions the work of hundreds of developers at flipkart. But what I wanted to convey is, as  a freelancer, If someone can mimic in short period of time the core functionality of flipkart that is shopping products, can I as a freelancer build a custom ecommerce with just core functionality to shop products for a small business with having to build a team and pull it off? Or am I missing something that would force me to must have a team?  


Edit 3: So I copied and pasted the exact question in chatgpt and the good part is that it didn't judge me or my dumbness, but answered it elaborately. This can be considered as fun experiment where mostly I recieved negative answers but some positive answers which tried to explain the same thing as chatgpt's answer. So naturally I got this question in my mind.

**How would a human attachment evolve to a real human community where he receives answers with some judgments, and to a AI Chatbot where he mostly receives answers without judgments? Will a typical man prefer real humans answers over AI Generated answers on the cost of his emotions?**

ChatGPT Answer

&gt;Your question touches on a common misconception about software development, especially among developers who are just starting out. While it's true that the basic functionality of websites and applications, like those of Codecademy, Quora, Pinterest, and Flipkart, could be built by a small team in a few months, the reality of developing such large-scale software is far more complex. Here are some of the critical aspects you might be missing:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;1. \*\*Software Complexity\*\*: Large-scale software like the ones you mentioned are not just about the primary functionality that they provide but also about the underlying complexities that come with scale \[Source 10\]([https://northell.design/blog/large-scale-software-development](https://northell.design/blog/large-scale-software-development)). This includes handling large amounts of data, managing multiple simultaneous users, ensuring high performance, and maintaining availability at any time. These complexities increase the time, effort, and skills required to build and maintain such software.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. \*\*Features and Enhancements\*\*: The initial version of the software might be simple, but as the product grows, new features and enhancements are continuously added to improve user experience and to stay competitive. This constant development requires a dedicated team of developers \[Source 10\]([https://northell.design/blog/large-scale-software-development](https://northell.design/blog/large-scale-software-development)).  
&gt;  
&gt;3. \*\*Testing and Quality Assurance\*\*: Large-scale software needs thorough testing to ensure that it works correctly and efficiently under various conditions. This requires a team of testers who work alongside developers to find and fix issues \[Source 0\]([https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/achieving-success-in-large-complex-software-projects](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/achieving-success-in-large-complex-software-projects)).  
&gt;  
&gt;4. \*\*Scalability and Performance\*\*: As the user base grows, the software must be able to scale and perform efficiently. This requires careful architecture and design decisions, as well as continuous monitoring and tweaking to handle increased loads \[Source 10\]([https://northell.design/blog/large-scale-software-development](https://northell.design/blog/large-scale-software-development)).  
&gt;  
&gt;5. \*\*Security\*\*: Large-scale software, especially those dealing with user data or financial transactions, must be secure. This requires a dedicated security team to ensure the software is secure from various threats \[Source 10\]([https://northell.design/blog/large-scale-software-development](https://northell.design/blog/large-scale-software-development)).  
&gt;  
&gt;6. \*\*Maintenance and Support\*\*: Once the software is live, it needs regular maintenance and support to fix issues, handle user queries, and ensure smooth operation. This requires a dedicated support team \[Source 0\]([https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/achieving-success-in-large-complex-software-projects](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/achieving-success-in-large-complex-software-projects)).  
&gt;  
&gt;7. \*\*Integration and Compatibility\*\*: Large-scale software often needs to integrate with other systems and should be compatible with various devices and platforms. This adds another layer of complexity to the development process \[Source 7\]([https://www.linkedin.com/advice/1/what-your-tips-managing-complex-software-development](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/1/what-your-tips-managing-complex-software-development)).  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;To handle all the above aspects, companies like Flipkart have hundreds of software engineers working on just the website. While it's possible to build a simple version of such software with a small team in a few months, building and maintaining a large-scale, feature-rich, secure, and efficient software is a complex task that requires a large and diverse team of professionals.

"I work for the central government in a tier 2 city. I began my IT career in 2009 after earning my CSE degree from a state university. I then worked for a couple of product-based organizations before switching to this job in 2017. I'm 35 years old, married, and have a kid aged 3. A friend persuaded me to apply for the CGL exam, and I cleared it in my first attempt and got posting in my hometown. There are hardly any promotions in this department, and there are almost no prospects of being transferred unless the managers become quite irritated with you. 
Due to a few factors, I wish to return to the IT industry and work there for the next 10 to 15 years.

1. I never lost interest in technology and used my coding skills to develop scripts and programs that made my job easier. In my free time, I used to assist my former coworkers in their work.
2. The present job work is also quite busy and will get more hectic in the coming days, even though it is not much of a mind work. You can automate your work only to a certain extent. Additionally, if you are the type of person that won't skip work, you will continually receive additional tasks. The higher-ups will not bother the individual who is idle. No room for growth in the department for those with technical skills.
3. Despite working for seven years, I continue to make less money than I did when I left the IT industry.
4. The only benefit of working here, which I don't think is a very good reason to hold back, is that no one can fire you. 
5. I have a few loans that I could be able to clear in a year or two. 
The tech stack I was working on (for 8 years) before I moved here:
Javascript, jQuery and Angular. Aware of Node.js.
.Net technologies with C# as programming language.
Oracle, SQL Server. worked on a range of enterprise level desktop and web applications.
What abilities should I develop if I wish to return to the IT industry? 
Can I apply for employment with the skills I have? How challenging is it to return after a 7-year absence. 
What new abilities should I learn that are useful in my day-to-day work, given that the usage of AI is becoming more integrated into the workplace?

But the H1B lottery chances seem horrible now and seems like they will only get worse till the time I graduate (in 2026).

The probable scenario seems like not getting picked and having to return after 3 years, not saving up much.

For MS:

* Pros  

   * Some chance of getting picked in the lottery, and have a possibly better life?
   * Possibly save a decent amount of money?
* Cons:  

   * Loan, if the market is still screwed by 2026, it will be a bit tricky
   * If I don't get picked in the lottery, returning after 3 years and starting things anew. I don't want to go to Canada/UK etc.
   * To me, it seems like an entirely pointless exercise if I have to return after the OTP ends.

Against MS:

* Pros:  

   * I will get to build my life here without disruptions
* Cons:  

   * I will always wonder, what could have been.
   * FOMO seeing all my batchmates immigrate and pursue a masters in the US.

It also seems like a ton of companies are decreasing H1B supported jobs in favour of hiring local candidates. Would that improve till 2026 or so?

Any perspective from y'all would be hugely appreciated!",Does my decision to no longer apply for an MS because of horrible H1B lottery chances seem correct?,0.85,9,Help,True,2023-10-24 12:05:41,,Weekly-Exchange3790,10,10,24,12,5,Tuesday,11.0
"Hi folks

I'm a 2nd year cse student interested in backend development. After exploring around a bit I've really started to enjoy writing code in golang. Currently exploring backend in golang with postgres, REST, rpc, docker and stuff. Although it seems like there's very little opportunities for golang for freshers. 

So I feel like I should pick up another stack alongside Go. Currently thinking about C# .NET and java. Have tried node+express and absolutely hated it, I really prefer strongly typed languages. So, any recommendations? What should I go with if my only concern is getting a job?

"**TLDR;**

I'm an Indie-dev working on [Folksable](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.folksable.app), available only on Android as of now, I wanted to design and develop a beautifully crafted habit and task-tracking app, the app provides minimal social features for a rewarding experience to getting things done and building habits.

&amp;#x200B;

[standby](https://preview.redd.it/r8mkdiy8d5wb1.png?width=2220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78c324f4da5ac2107a9ae53e4ee1acad07208f16)

&amp;#x200B;

**My Story &amp; Why I'm Working on Folksable:**

In late 2022, I had some free time and I imagined a great new year, I already had a list of things I wanted to learn or get better at including learning to swim and making a habit of evening walks to reflect to think about the big picture and so on, started the new year as planned for a week or so, but pretty soon I realized there was no support system and feedback mechanism, so then I tried all the top habit tracking apps on the play store, none of them were giving delightful experience to make me want to return to the app and very few of them had minimal and necessary social features to help develop habits by using reward design like snap. or Instagram.

so as a dev, I wanted to take a shot at it and decided to work on it starting with researching habits and the formation of new habits, reading countless articles, listening to podcasts, reading many of the currently popular books on the topic, they profoundly changed my understanding and world-view about habits, and I began to instill all the insights I gathered into the product.

Well, there are many apps in the market that function similarly, you create an entry, get a reminder, tick a box, and get some graphs on how you perform, that can work well for some people, but I believe habit-building is greatly enhanced with a social experience that rewards good behavior and sharing photo updates of your habits to your friends was what I decided to build the product around.

I have implemented a user-friendly interface with a visually appealing design and delightful interactions to make the habit and task-tracking experience enjoyable.

With Folksable I Focused on three main things:

* Simplicity, Elegance, Delight.
* Detailed Stats and Visualisation of progress.
* Social Features for Reward Mechanism.

[Folksable](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.folksable.app) introduces two main components:

1. ""Rituals"" for recurring events.
2. ""Tasks"" for one-off events.

Users can invite their friends to join their rituals and view the leaderboards of ritual members. Each ritual has a start date and an optional end date. Visual streak indicators ensure that users maintain their streak and do not break it. Users also have the option to pause a ritual and sync it with their device calendar.

The scheduling options for rituals are versatile, ranging from daily to once every five years. To ensure privacy, the app offers granular controls for both rituals and tasks.

Furthermore, on the roadmap, the app will let users log custom measures during each check-in. They can access detailed statistics based on the time of check-in, their custom measures, frequency of check-ins, and completion rate. Users will also be able to like and comment on each other's check-ins.

I'm excited to offer a **free premium version for 6 months** to all users who download and try out Folksable, the reason is simple, any early adopters of a project deserve that, and some of the features are a work in progress, it would be great to collect and work on your feedback, I hope that this app will help you achieve your goals and build positive habits.

Folksable is a project we are very passionate about. My goal is to help people easily develop habits, which I think is one of the most powerful methods to fundamentally change your life.

The project is in active development, and I welcome any kind of feedback, so feel free to share your thoughts!","I always struggled to establish new habits, so I built an app that actually helped me.",0.81,3,I Made This :snoo_wink:,True,2023-10-24 18:24:05,,rdhikshith,1,10,24,18,24,Tuesday,4.0

"So I'm currently working as a database engineer in a certain organization. Before getting selected there I was applying at other companies for the position of software developer and in one of those companies(let's call it X) I passed the technical interview. Now there was only the final interview remaining which they said they would be taking soon. 1.5 months passed and there was no correspondence from their side and due to certain circumstances at my home, I had to take up an offer for the role of a database engineer.

Recently that same company X reached out to me and asked to be prepared for the final interview. But as you know I am already working as a database engineer from Monday to Saturday 9:30-5. So does anyone have any kind of advice as to how I should approach this situation, like should I take a day off for the interview and tell my manager about this or do I tell her after the interview has been cleared successfully?

Also they've reached out to me with filling some forms regarding Life Insurance EPF etc.(they will take it I think on onboarding day), have also got my offer kit(will get laptop after joining though) so does that mean I am good with my Bgv process?

With a total of 5 years of experience under my belt, here's where I stand:  
4 years in automation testing and 1 year in front-end development using React.js (all in a single company).

"I’m 41M, graduated in CS Engineering. I chose this stream of education because of my passion for coding. I was good at coding. I studied various languages like Pascal, Fortran, Cobol, C, C++, Abap, Python, and concepts of DSA, DB, OS, basically all Computer Science Engineering content.
But my first job was testing role, then product owner, consultant. Never had a chance to work in coding. Primarily I worked in large enterprise software companies which had PSU like culture. But honestly I was always in imposter syndrome which made my worklife miserable. But I chugged along with these jobs because it paid the bills. Deep inside I always have this unfulfilled desire and resentment that I didn’t do justice to my passion and wasted my CS engineering degree.
Now at this point in my life (at age 41) after reading about people (mostly westerners who pivot their career to software jobs in their 40s, 50s) I thought I should also take an action and do something. But sometimes it feels futile doing it here in India considering the sheer number of engineering graduates in India every year and content posted by youngsters (especially on twitter, YT, reddit) hustling at this. What path should i chose? so many tech stacks, new languages both for frontend and backend. I might be at serious disadvantage because of age and past work experience. My resume would be easily sidelined or trashed without even giving a chance.
I also feel, what I am trying to do is right thing to do especially because my peers, batchmates, age mates are getting down the ramp from work (FIRE movement). I am so disillusioned at the moment. Appreciate your thoughts and feedback.

Edit 1: I sincerely thank each one of you for taking your time to read this post, providing your feedback and sharing your thoughts.

"Hey folks,

I'm on a quest to land a game development job or internship, and I could use some advice, considering my not-so-stellar education background. Here's a quick rundown:

**Education History:**

10th Grade: 5.2 GPA

Diploma in Electrical Engineering: 7.5 GPA

B.Tech in Electronic Engineering: 7.0 GPA, but it took me 4 years due to a 1-year backlog. I should have graduated in 2021, but it ended up being 2022 because of the backlog.

**Career Twist:**

I completed a Data Analyst course in May and moved to Chennai in September to find a job.However, as time went by, I became more interested in Game Development. Within a month, I built some cool projects and, yes, exaggerated a bit on my resume. This landed me an interview, where the interviewer called me out on my projects and certifications I hadn't actually completed. I came clean, admitting I was still learning, and did okay on the coding round (1 out of 2).

It's been nearly a month, and I'm yet to hear back from them.

**Current Status:**

I'm now focused on challenging projects and diving into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and programming.

**My Skills:**

I can work independently with little guidance.I'm empathetic and understand people without bias.

I can handle high-pressure situations without burning out.

I enjoy tackling tasks creatively when time allows.

As a fun fact, I learned to backflip and beatbox, showing I'm up for a challenge!

**Seeking Advice:**

I'm on the hunt for a Game Dev role in Chennai or remotely, despite my less-than-stellar academic history. I'm aiming for a salary in the range of 10k - 15k. Any tips on job searching, skill improvement, or companies open to unique backgrounds would be much appreciated.

I have applied to \~500 companies (on LinkedIn, and company websites) since august and have received interview invites from maybe 10 companies.

I know the market for C++ is smaller than say for Java/JS/python but even roles I am moe than well suited for are giving straight rejects. (No beef but a certain virtualization company seems to have blacklisted my profile cuz it's auto reject even for roles that require only 1 YOE).

"Hey everyone, so I am dev having a professional work ex of 2+ years. I have been working for a product based company since I graduated and let's just say work wise it was fine. (Too much work, otherwise really good).

 I completed engineering from a tier 3 college and luckily got a decently paying job basis my knowledge in DSA and participating in lots of programming competitions.  

I have been in this company since the start of my career and I gotta say, the concepts that I learned during college ( DSA, Mongo) helped me quickly get onboarded with the work in my organisation. In my case, I didn't do 100s of frameworks just for the sake of knowing them, instead I focused on basic programming concepts and it helped me get started with almost anything at work. 

I have reached a point where I feel my learning has reached saturation and It might be time I start reaching out to my friends for referrals ( since the job market is ass right now).

"I started working in AdTech domain few months back and I came across something I wouldn't believe otherwise.
It happened when my manager assigned me my first task in the big data project. So there is this metrics we have which keeps track of traffic on a particular page. On one particular day, it was quite down. So my task was to find out why there was this dip. 

When I first heard it, I was pretty much like ""how do I know. Its people traffic. And there are billions of people on earth. And there can be trillions of permutations as to why there was less people on the page. And there can be even more number of randomness! How am I supposed to narrow it down?""
Okay that was my exact reaction. But fast forwarding, there was some issue we found out on digging. 
And it totally blew out my mind to realise how there is always some pattern followed.. every single second..every single minute.. every single moment.. in every randomness... 
May be now you are opening this post. May be you are not. May be you had hundred of other options in this feed to choose from. But just think! Whatever you are doing, no matter whatever you are doing, it is bound to follow some pattern!

"Hello everyone.

I work in an MNC as a contract employee, as a software engineer. It's been 1.4 years. My salary is 25k per month. This is my first on hands experience tho my age is 27.

One more point to add, to the parent company I'm working, to them I'm a temporary employee.

I developed till now Desktop, mobile, Alexa applications. With will interact with a hardware product.

Other internal employees in my team have 6 plus years of experience, I work the same as them. They treat me like that. I try to give my best.

Problem:

I didn't get hike, it's been more than a year and my salary is still 25k.

10k house rent
5k home
2k per month playstation emi
1k current bill and sim card recharge.

With 7k, I'll live my life.

Rite now I'm not feeling satisfied with the job, It feels like I'm working more but getting paid less. I have asked my parent company to give me hike, but they are just postponing and never giving hike .

I want to leave and do a different job or start my own business to make the world more better place (no money tho).

To leave job, my experience is 1.4 and there are very less jobs for 1.4 years. How can I get a job, the nature of contract employee job is to be removed anytime. I believe December will be the end of my contract.

What should I do?

I am sorry for sobbing, technology is great, will develop for free. But I'm giving my time here to a certain organisation, in return they pay me.

Time is precious, 27 years ko many people own cars and houses. I'm still in povety line, just wanted to improve my lifestyle.

This is what I wanted to say, please tell me your point of views.

One more thing, my parent company said they will make me internal employee with 5.5 lpa package, share your thoughts on this too. (I don't know if it's true or they are faking to postpone my hike)

"*This can be a long post, but please try to understand my concern.*

I'm a **CSE23 pass out** from a **Tier 3 college**, have 2 offers, **one from a WITCH company out of my home state and another for a Business Analyst role in a good MnC in Delhi NCR, my hometown, at the same CTC of around 7.**

WITCH is here TCS Digital, using W to denote it...

*From the start of my final year, one year ago, I don't feel the same anymore in my life and personality, I used to be very enthusiastic about technology and my field, everything related to CSE.*

I wished earlier that I would get good company in my hometown which is Delhi NCR, work happily for 1 2 years, and move ahead in my career with mental peace and a happy mind.

I cracked this W company, I was very happy, then cracked the BA MnC and felt too happy that yes I am enough capable to crack job offers from two good companies.

*The W company changed our location in South India where I never ever planned to move initially because I really didn't want to move from my hometown as planned until I got a very good offer, I live in Delhi NCR so there are ample opportunities here too, but W promised us NCR, but never fulfilled and, I did a mistake by trusting it...*

*The BA MnC company Delayed our joining up to March 24 and I have to wait...*

I was happy that at least W wouldn't fire me in such hard times when every company is doing layoffs and the market is at its worst. So, I believe that joining W will be a good option, never applied very much to other companies because of Layoff risks in startups, again I made the same mistake, but a bigger one. 

*Seeing all the negative reviews about W has totally devastated my mental peace about working there, like at what cost I should relocate and work there if the Service company is worthless to join as a fresher and the work doesn't matter at all, at the end I have to study by myself, and why suffer and degrade mental peace by working there?*  
*I feel very overwhelmed, sometimes I feel I should quit this career field and start preparing for something else, either government job preparation, GATE, or anything else, or move forward with my BA role job and again try for Software Engineering by working there or seek my career in BA.*  
*Indeed I prepared to crack these jobs in my 4 year Engineering to come so far, but I can't think properly about what I really want from my life at this stage.* 

Or just sit at home, upskilling, and get a decent job in my hometown, by risking the next 6 more months, around 1 year unemployed after my Graduation, and get any job lower than the above Job offers.

I don't feel fine from inside, My mind is in always panic mode, seeing the life challenges in IT and working in a WITCH company, the struggles of relocation, and living a struggling life away from my family which I never planned before, feeling too negative from inside.

I need to relocate in one month for W, which will onboard me in December, I am already pressured mentally, and I am confused, idk, and sometimes I feel I should visit a Psychologist because of such behavior and consult a Career counselor too..  
*I have questions like what will happen If I get a poor project and I don't learn anything? What if I feel homesick in another state? What If there is some emergency?What If there is nobody to comfort me in my hard times in another state? What if I feel stuck after joining W? How will I manage to live alone far away from my family if I need them or if they need me? how will I switch to a better company before hitting 1 year because I don't want to stay there anymore?*

**I have asked these things earlier too.**

 **Some say:**

**You should care for your career more than your comfort at this age, so whatever you are getting, just take it and move ahead in life, one day, you will cherish the struggle you faced earlier, you are panicking because you are still immature and not willing to grow in life, come out of comfort zone and face life challenges, nothing will happen, you are not alone and first to suffer such things, that's how we all grow and succeed in our lives, after few years, everything will be fine ok, Goodluck.**

**Some say:**

**You should do what your mind says because Mental peace and health are everything, no money, and success can replace your peace of life, so pursue what your heart says and let time decide what happens next, give your best in whatever you decide, you can always change your career and path whenever you want, nobody is late and nobody is weak, we all have different life stories and success stories too, so live happily and do what you love.**

But again, I am confused and panicking, asking here to seek some support from experienced folks who have seen hard times and understand life way better than me, so mentors.

This guy spent 2 years of college with me and we stayed good friends even after college, and it's just frustrating seeing him like this. Long story short, he finished his 1year react course in this April, and has had one internship of 2 months since then. That's it, no offers or even interviews after it. Now, he's just depressed apparently because of the market for non-it freshers. This guy is someone I literally admired in college lol. Got good grades, excellent team worker, even had goals unlike me. he choose aviation diploma after 12th because he had two dreams: aviation and coding. 

He even worked for Etihad at KIAL for almost a year, but the night shifts and low pay just screwed his health. Somehow convinced his family to take a year off because he wanted to give coding a serious chance. He finished his web development course this year and after one unpaid internship, he's had no luck at anything.

I know he was down because of the market, but he still applied everyday and I was sure he'll get something good. Months later and still nothing.I called him today hoping to cheer him up telling to hang out on a Sunday and asked if he had any plans. He replied, ""Nothing, I'm done actually. I'm not even gonna apply anywhere today. Just gonna sit and rethink decisions.""

One of the brightest people I know, and it just hurts seeing him depressed like this. For context, he's skilled in frontend and UI/ux development with react. How can I help him??

"Hello fellow Redditors,

I am mediocre student and in my last year of completing Bachelors in Computer Engineering. I come from normal middle class family and don't know whether should I pursue masters abroad like Canada or Australia or do a normal job here. Although I am really skeptical about going Canada considering people don't get part time jobs that easily and as per Australia, I heard they have less tech opportunities. Also, the only way I can pursue a master's degree is by taking a loan and I don't want to accumulate substantial debt that could potentially hinder my financial freedom in future.

While here maximum salary I can get is 3-4 LPA. I mean I really want to explore other countries which I don't think I will be able to do if I stay here.

So, I really want your advice that what should I do whether grind here and become better or take a risk and opt for masters?

I value your experiences and insights, and I'm eager to hear your recommendations. Feel free to share your thoughts, advice or any personal experience that can bring me some clarity.

"Hello,

I'm currently a second-year undergraduate at a top IIT, and I often hear about the fantastic networking opportunities and career advantages that come with being part of this esteemed institution. However, I'm having trouble visualizing how people practically leverage this network in the corporate world.

Adding to this, I'm an introvert and have a close-knit group of friends, even though I get along well with many people I meet. As I look ahead 3-4 years into the future, I'm curious about how these connections could be of tangible help.

Specifically, I have a few questions:

1. Close Friend Circle: How can my close friends play a role in my career? Is there a way to expand this circle for networking?
2. Acquaintances and Contacts: I've met numerous people during my time at IIT, but not all are close connections. What role do these contacts play in the long term, and how can I strengthen these relationships?
3. Alumni: The IIT alumni hold top positions in many Indian and Global firms. But what is their perspective towards helping students from their alma matter? How and why do they actually help?

I would greatly appreciate any advice, insights, or personal experiences from individuals who have successfully navigated these challenges, especially for those who, like me, are introverted. Kindly focus more on the corporate side rather than the startup side.

My question is open to everyone, especially for people who graduated from IITs/NITs/IIITs/IIMs/DTU/NSUT/IISc/IISERs/ISI, etc and people possessing industry experience.

"I (24M) out of panic that I didn't have a job joined a WITCH company last year. The bond period was of 1 yr, starting from August 2022. 1.5 months after the completion of the capstone project, i.e., in November, I, along with a few other freshers were assigned to a client project. The client is a big company, however the project is only operational/support in nature. I am doing an excellent work here, that is what my managers (both at the client and the WITCH company) tell me. I had even worked for 1hr - 2hr more on a few occassions so as to rectify issues in production. This made the managers think that I have grasped the project thoroughly which I do not think is the case. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I am tired of this. There is no career growth in this as I am not doing anything related to engineering. The shift is even there on weekends and often gets extended if the production is bad. I often get tagged in teams even during breakfast or lunch and it has been ages since I had been relax. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can the folks here at this subreddit advise me on how I can leave the WITCH company as well as the client project? What should I tell the manager in case he tries to berate me for thinking about leaving the project and the company? 

**Note 1:** I had completed my Bachelors in Electrical and Electronics from a Tier-3 college which operates under a major university in Delhi. I had worked on several projects during my undergrad, like a remote controlled rover, a ball balancing platform, and even developed a DOS for IBM PC.

**Note 3:** Last year, from Feb till May I committed myself to working on my major project and that is why I didn't apply to many job openings.

So, my friend received an assignment, completed it, and submitted it on time. After submitting the assignment, he received a message from HR informing him that there would be an interview with the company's founder. Although it was supposed to be a non-technical round, during the interview, they unexpectedly asked him technical questions. He answered them all, and afterward, the founder mentioned that they would get back to him within two days.

However, a week passed with no response, so my friend decided to text the HR department. They responded, saying they would provide an update the next day. He gave them an additional three days, during which he didn't receive any communication and then they informed him that he was not selected.

In response, he messaged them, expressing his disappointment, stating that he had put a lot of effort into the assignment, working day and night. He also mentioned that if they intended to conduct a casual interview, they should have done so before assigning the task. However, HR did not reply.

In hindsight, my friend now realizes that it might not have been appropriate to argue in this manner after being rejected.

"Hello All,

I am a Mechanical graduate from a Tier-2 Uni in 2022. I have joined a HSE consultancy company thinking I would work only for 1-2 years and then move abroad for my Master's. I didn't like the consulting work and thought of quitting in Jan 2022. My manager then convinced me that he would provide me with an opportunity to work on software development. I accepted it. For first 2 months I had to work with Unreal Engine and build a simple tool that would help us internally for our consultancy projects.

 Then I was shifted to another development project which is a desktop application that used Python, PyQT framework for the front end , and VTK for back end. It also used MYSQL database. I absolutely enjoyed what I was doing. WLB was good, Pay was good and the people in the company are pretty chill. It has been 8-9 months now. The project is almost done. We are going to involve some ML and Neural network models as well. I honestly don't know how we are going to apply these models here. My manager is a very technical guy but still,l I don't have the confidence if we are going to succeed or not.

The problem is our company doesn't have a dedicated software team for this project. It is just me and my manager. I feel that I can't use this as an experience when I try to shift to other companies. I believe I don't have any relevant work experience except for knowing Python and MySQL. Which are not very exceptional skills if I am looking for a new offer.

Tech stack - C#, .NET, Python, SQL. 

 I earn about 70k per month post tax &amp; about 35k of which is my monthly spending. (includes rent, food, travel, bills) All the rest of the money goes into mutual funds &amp; stocks. 

I want to find ways to earn more. Currently I'm exploring these options -

1. Masters in Software Engineering in USA: I don't have any financial backup.Nothing as collateral to take loan against. It's a big risk &amp; a big decision with all my investments at stake. 

2. Upskilling myself and switch: I have already started prepping with DSA. I am reading software engineering articles by great companies, great developers. I am also learning good system design principles thoroughly. Will also work on some side projects. 

But again, I feel there's crazy competition in India. Limited jobs &amp; high resource availability.

"2 yoe here. Around 5 months ago, I wrote a backend REST API for fetching some information from the DB and it was committed to production. Recently I made another API that the frontend team is using, in conjunction with this API, and our tech lead found a bug in production with the API. This has happened quite a few times before even after considering every scenario where things could go wrong, and things still go wrong.

Our company also doesn’t have a dedicated test environment. Almost all the code we push goes to the production server, and our company is not actively working on any test frameworks that I can write test cases on. I also tried to write unit test cases for new code once, but they said that we are still working on that, no need to write testcases.

For these errors, I am extremely worried that more issues will pop up to bite me in the ass, and that my review will not be very favourable for me, and may end up in a worst-case scenario. Any suggestions as to what I can do to ameliorate my situation? 

Also in case things go really bad, any companies that I can look into that is keen on hiring Python or Java developers? I have 2 yoe in Python, and no professional (but project level) experience in Java. I prefer to work remotely for now.

"Hello devs,
This is my first ever reddit post and I really need some help here.
I want to design a system where my users can schedule emails for any time slot and my system can handle the delivery.
I have more than 3k users and each user is having a limit of 500 emails they can schedule per day. Now lets say all the users have scheduled their emails at the same time than it will have around 15,00,000 emails and I have  around 30-40 minutes to send them all.
I also have a limitation on email service provider side that I can't send a particular user 's email in parallel other wose the emails will get caught in throttling. So for each user his there should be at least 3 second delay between every mail.
Please suggest some design or message queuing system I can use here.
Please keep in my tge throttling, that's my main bottle neck. Also the system should be scalable if my user base increase upto tens of thousands

Edit-1
Current implementation:
We have slot for every 30 minutes and a user can schedule emails in future upto 3 months ahead.
We store the receivers, subject, body and timestamp of sending in our database and with the help of a CRON in every 30 minutes we fetch all the emails which are scheduled for that slot.

We are using SQS queues for preparing the email content ( queue-1) that is for each user we have a job in the queue that prepares the email body and dispatches the prepared body to a next common queue (queue-2) which have all the emails ready to be delivered and we have some workers that picks up those emails and delivers them.
Now the problem is if that queue-2 has all emails of a single user than workers will pick all the emails of that single user and it will cause throttling and the emails will get failed because there should be some time delay between each mail of tge same user.

"I think I am not the only one who has come across this very popular opinion at least once while working, specially in Tech. I don't know how or why this originated, but I feel, while it may make sense for a lot of people, to impose this onto everyone and make it a norm would be a really bad idea. 

Job, programming, studies, can be a means to an end for a lot. And there is nothing wrong with that. But at the same time, it is also true a lot of people join this sector , because this interests them. Sure money is a factor, money will always matter, and things like status and whatnot and material possessions would matter too for them. But to say that it should be the only thing that you should really care about, would be a bad idea, honestly a bad example to set for anyone who would be coming to this side.

Somehow I fail to understand, how can anyone continue working and doing ""good"" work if they have no interest, other than the money/living they get to earn. But then again, everyone is different, and hence, to each their own. 

But that doesn't mean you get to make fun of the person who wanted to improve something, or tried to even though there was no monetary or career specific gain. Sure it would be stupid (mostly) to work with the sole aim that doing xyz would get me a promotion/ hike. But there exists people too who do because they care about what they are building.

We seem to appreciate companies when their products think about a certain aspect which caters to a very few people, or a very specific thing, which wasn't the product's original goal to solve/ provide as a service. I feel most of these things come from people who care, people who go that extra mile , either for that hike ( which might not be the best ) or for improving the product/ service, and as a consumer we almost always appreciate them for it, not them but the company.

This may just be because a lot of us are stuck in places where they don't want to be, and it sucks, but at the same time I feel this should not become the general voice. While switching from a toxic place , and giving everyone the empowerment to make sure they switch the second their employer does something toxic is something that needs to happen more, I feel we should also talk about places which are also ready to acknowledge and be better.

Jobs may be a means to an end, but it can flourish into something more than that. It can be the next big thing in your life, and I feel it is okay to try that out. Some places will be thankless, but at the end it is also us who will be the managers, executives, and maybe even CEOs. Maybe something like that would actually help everyone have a more fulfilling work life.

"Hey all,

I (M26) am a 3D/VFX artist with five years of experience in the film industry, and I'm at a crossroads in my career. When I first started, I was passionate about VFX and 3D, graduated B.Sc in Digital Media and it was a dream come true to work in Hollywood movies. However, the reality of the film industry isn't as colorful as I initially thought.

I began my career earning 20k per month, and now I'm making 70k before deductions. While I get cool points for my job, I find myself super dissatisfied with my salary. I once attempted to go abroad for further studies, but visa rejections were a roadblock.

So, I've decided it's time for a change. I'm more than willing to invest my free time in learning new skills. I've recently started exploring game engines as well as stock trading, but I'm also considering shifting my career towards development roles.

"Hello everyone,

I recently received resumes from a few individuals who have recently graduated from universities in the USA. Their resumes were minimalistic, in black and white, lacking bold elements or distinctive formatting like columns. After checking with them i got to know that in the United States, hiring managers and recruiters generally prefer straightforward resumes without cosmetic enhancements. 

I understand the significance of content in a resume, but I'm curious if this holds true for Indian recruiters. Do they share a similar preference?

"This is my first post and wanted your opinions because I'm really confused about what to do regarding my career, what I mean by that is I've already got a decent-paying job where my role is a full-stack engineer in a startup where I do front-end, back-end and a little bit of DevOps.

For the past couple of months, I have been working with a few internal team members to accomplish their new startup idea which is built upon Generative AI (around diffusion models). I wrote most of the front-end, end-to-end backend &amp; deployment of models as well. Now they've secured VC funding &amp; offered me a full-time role (Founding engineer) at their startup that has 5-lakhs more than my current salary. Keep in mind both of my jobs are in-office and accepting this new role would then lead me to relocate to a different place. Also, considering the current market it is unlikely that I would get an increment at my current job in the upcoming years so switching jobs is the only way to get a higher salary.

Now the main problem is most of the work I do now involves trying different models, training &amp; inspecting if they are good or not for production, so basically more of this kind of work and less engineering work like designing systems, etc. Also, I've no clue about how these models internally work &amp; feel no motivation to try and understand their internals since it seem very different from normal engineer domains. Some of the issues I face have no answer or feel clueless to me since I've little to no knowledge about ML.

I recently went through an interview process with Apollo for a technical role in Mumbai, and I have to say, it was an absolute letdown. The interview lasted less than 10 minutes, and it was painfully clear that the interviewer had little interest in assessing my skills or qualifications.

To make matters worse, after the rushed interview, they had us waiting for an agonizing six hours for the results. It's disheartening to see such a lack of respect for candidates' time and efforts.

What truly baffled me was the seemingly arbitrary selection of candidates. Out of five randomly chosen individuals, two were selected simply due to the guise of 'women empowerment.' While empowering women is essential, it should not be an excuse for overlooking qualified candidates based on their gender.

Adding to the disappointment was the online test, which was conducted on SurveyMonkey with absolutely no proctoring. There was no supervisor present in the class, leaving ample room for potential misconduct. Astonishingly, out of 300 candidates who took the test, only 50 were shortlisted. This glaring discrepancy raises serious questions about the integrity and fairness of their selection process.

This experience sheds light on a concerning trend in big companies, where candidates are subjected to subpar interview processes, leading to wasted time, energy, and ultimately, dashed hopes. It's high time we demand transparency, respect, and fairness in the hiring process.

I hope sharing my experience will serve as a cautionary tale for others navigating the treacherous waters of corporate interviews.

"Our company is trying to hire a Devops engineer for some months and I am taking first round of interviews. Let me state the expectations first

Total domain =&gt; [https://roadmap.sh/devops](https://roadmap.sh/devops)

1. 0-2 years | git, CICD tool(any) + process , python, linux, networking. Linux, networking in college level only
2. 2-4 years | above plus any tools they have worked upon (containers/terraform/ansible/), simple solutioning on load balancing, cloud , secrets management
3. 4-8 years | above plus complete and advance solutioning , monitoring, app performance
4. 8+ | solutioning and architecting 

Knowing that it is not possible to know everything , I have been asking questions from their CV only with the expectation that we can train them with our requirements. here is what I found

1. Most people have mentioned working in CICD but doesn't know actually is CICD and why do we require.
2. Jenkins is the most popular tool found in these CV's
3. AWS is the most common but people have hardly explored beyond EC2, S3. 
4. All of them has faked atleast something in their CV. While around 10% is acceptable, but more than 50% , totally not cool.
5. 80% of the candidates don't know a single programming language (even python).
6. Candidates claimed to have worked with load balancing but doesn't know the difference between application and network load balancers. Couldn't even ask about load balancing mechanism. 
7. Few candidates claimed to have worked with AWS Route 53 but doesn't know how DNS policies work (A record, CNAME, MX) 
8. People don't know what a subnet is but are expected to believe they wrote networking policies
9. Most of them doesn't know how to work with git. 
10. Only around 1 or 2 candidates knew about best practices of technologies
11. All of them mentions Kubernetes but fails to answer how to launch a pod or how to give access to someone or difference between deployments and stateful set.
12. Most candidates are coming from XZY service based companies and know only about CICD pipelines (even experienced candidates)
13. Could pass only 10-20% to second round. All basic questions were asked

With the advent of ChatGPT and bard, we are looking at a crisis. These service based companies would be losing devops clients requiring them to pivot. Only few would survive.

**Conclusion:** Fake it till you make it ! But overdo it and you lose the chance.

PS: Don't ask for referral since I will need to take first round , so conflict of Interest

Edit : 
Since people are asking about position
1. Multiple positions (beginner to experienced) for multiple projects
2. Pay differs according to experience
3. Both product and service based companies.

So I need to design the page as shown in the gif above. Lets break down the different parts.

* Initially it is a landing page, with some typography and a 100vh styling, so is the next section.
* Now comes the part where the animation that is seen is rendered as the user keeps scrolling
* at some points during this scroll, a couple of texts show up on the left side.
* Eventually it merges with the last section where the background keeps changing.

This onscroll animation technique is very similar to that of what is used by apple on their website. I was wondering if this is possible to implement using react, and if there were any third party libraries that could make it easier.

I did some research to see how [apple implements it](https://css-tricks.com/lets-make-one-of-those-fancy-scrolling-animations-used-on-apple-product-pages/), and learnt that they use a HTML Canvas component with onscroll listeners, I tried to implement that but there were a few issues.

1. As its seen the scroll animation starts only from the 3rd section, but in apples implementation, the onscroll listeners will catch even the scroll initially.
2. I was unable to figure out about how to render the text on the left side at a particular time while using a canvas.
3. The end screen (with the different backgrounds) also seemed hard to implement.

What method do you suggest? I prefer using react. I have about 300 image files, which are frame by frame images of the entire animation.

"A newly joined junior (2+ yoe) gives the know-it-all vibes to everyone in my team. He word-vomits during our calls and speaks non-sense in person. Basically, he is a LinkedIn influencer in person, who has written a couple of articles on Medium and now thinks he has been hired to single handedly disrupt the entire existing tech stack. And the worst part is he downplays all the other teams' efforts by condescendingly referring to them as ""backward in tech"", before his boss. 

This is causing his boss, who is not very tech literate, to set unreasonable expectations for other teams, including mine. I was not involved in his hiring so I do not know how this even happened. He does not work in my team but is constantly engaging with us on projects. He talks to my team, where some have over 15+ yoe, in an imposing tone, like he owns us to work for him.

He has done little to no work himself so far; everything is on whiteboards. We've tried everything to guide him while respecting his aspirations but all he says is, ""I'm not able to apply my full skills here, because there is too much tech backwardness"",  which is not true.

"Hi,

I’m a final year undergraduate student, with campus placements already going in full swing

So far, I’ve attended only one sit-down interview..
However, I feel like, interview is a lot more than showing your skills. It’s about making yourself resonate with the needs of the recruiter 

I had a decent resume, with several interesting and practical projects along with freelance experience.
I was able to cohesively express myself in the interview 
I’ve been a self learner and a firm believer that companies don’t really care about the certifications and other para-academic credentials more than the actual skills

But my experience with the interviewer makes me question that.
Is it important that I present myself as someone who is a hard worker with being done enough certifications or is it better to come out as a smart guy?

Also, I noticed that a lot of interviews are conducted by HR people who have little to no technical grasp. So, how do you approach that?

"Hey 

I've been working at a small analytics firm that's transitioning from being service-based to developing its own products. I'm the first developer-centric person on the team, and I've been trying to introduce software development best practices like using Git for version control, modular code, and writing tests for functions. (the team really backwards in terms of software development)

&amp;#x200B;

However, the existing codebase is in a rough state, and it's been a challenge to convince my manager, who's more on the data science and analytics side, to make structural changes. The app we're building in R Shiny initially had code written by someone with no programming experience, leading to inefficiencies like using over 1000 global variables and a single function that performs 100 unrelated tasks. Perhaps the most challenging part is that the app is expected to handle large datasets in the gigabytes, yet it lacks a proper database to support this.

&amp;#x200B;

To address some of the challenges, I've taken the initiative to lead by example.  I've implemented changes like using Git for version control instead of zip files (resolving merge conflicts and resolving any issues which would come up from my teammates), And whenever a new feature addition is given to me I  would follow everything I had informed him, like creating modular codes using box package in R, having renv for package management, and introducing unit testing for our functions. To demonstrate the benefits, I revamped parts of an application, showcasing significant improvements in terms of memory and time efficiency - sometimes as much as 70-80%. 

&amp;#x200B;

Despite my efforts to demonstrate the benefits of best practices, my manager doesn't seem to see the necessity for structural changes, even though the app is expected to handle large datasets without a proper database. It's frustrating because I often feel heard, but no action would be taken when I bring up these concerns.

&amp;#x200B;

What's been particularly challenging is that we often find ourselves in a cycle where he identifies a problem, and we suggest a well-considered solution, but my manager dismisses it as too time-consuming. Instead, quick and dirty fixes are applied, which don't completely solve the issue and inevitably lead to new problems down the line. The frustrating part is that the same issue often resurfaces, and we find proposing the same solution, only to repeat the cycle.

&amp;#x200B;

I've felt overwhelmed by constant, unnecessary UI changes and small changes for the sake of making changes. It's like we're in a loop of tweaking things without a clear development process.  It all reached a breaking point, and I had a tough conversation with my manager about the issues and it was ugly. Now, I feel that I might become a target because some individuals who spoke up before me encountered certain issues. However, I also believe that he might not want to target me since he wouldn't want to interfere with the only developer on the team, whereas the other developers are analytical graduates with more interest in data science.

&amp;#x200B;

On a personal note, my colleagues from other departments are close friends. I've built strong relationships within the firm, and it's worth mentioning that I know many of their parents and family members too. This is why I'm hesitating to consider leaving. Instead, I'm pondering whether transferring to another department with a development team might offer a solution that aligns better with my professional goals and values.

&amp;#x200B;

Since My manager holds the title of associate director, I'm also wrestling with concerns about potential repercussions if I have to a different department.

"Hello DevIndia,

I’m a startup founder in India looking to expand my team and fill various positions. Currently, I’m struggling to find the right talent. My primary methods have been LinkedIn, referrals, and reaching out to few engineering colleges. Out of 15 hires, only 2 performed well, and they were interns. I encountered one candidate with high salary expectations we couldn’t meet.

I’m open to try suggested methods and open to remote working conditions for those who can dedicate at least 4-6 hours per day initially. Any advice on how to improve my hiring process and find dedicated individuals in India? Is it challenging to find committed talent ? 

Your insights and suggestions are greatly appreciated!

I posted this to know how to hire people not for hiring, but if you people are interested in the positions we are looking to hire, here is the list.

Positions we are looking to hire are 

1. UI/UX add-on if they can work on and build 3D assets can pay upto 30k/ based on project. 
2. Web development internships can’t pay more than 15k. 
3. Optical design engineer - 30-35k/contract based 
4. Electronics engineer - Intern or Jr level
5. GIS architect - (25-50k depending on the experience)

"So I interviewed with this company for the position of a Director and it all went well. They gave me an offer which had an increase of 10% whereas I wanted 20%. I have rejected the offer and they mentioned that they can't increase it. So we had a closure and it was amicable.

In my current company I'm three levels down the Director and it would take me sometime to reach that level here.

So I was wondering should I jump for the title change , work there for some time and jump again given the obvious boost in my role.

Or stay in my current company (which I will feel will give similar hike) but not a title or role boost. Of course the advantage in my current company is that I have been here for 3 years, know people, have built a reputation. The other company is a risk that I will take and I have heard mixed reviews about it from current employees.

"Working with both type of clients, I have some observations to share.

Indian clients lacks funding/budget. US are truly the Richie Riches. 100% of the times Indian clients want a free PoC or workshops whereas US clients are willing to pay tens of thousands of dollar for PoCs and hundreds of thousands for a workshop + some sort of MVPs.

Attitude in calls. When ICs realize that solution offered is way more than their budget, they'll start asking very specific feature or functionality, and when you say it has not been implemented yet, they'll be like ""hame to yehi chahiye tha"" to walk out of that call unembarrassed as if they are shoping with roadside vendors. USCs will say they not planned such a big budget for this yet, but will plan something for next year.

Trying to be know it all. ICs even when they bring business people on call who have very little tech knowledge, will try to school you rather than listen for atleast 5min straight. USCs will engage in a dialogue but will not try to outsmart you.

Some ICs truly have fufa mentality, i.e., they get upset quickly. We prioritize our calls depending on client readiness. If a client is wasting our time with no money in pocket, we put them below other opportunities. In that case they'll get upset to such extent that they'll stop responding to mails.

Basic humanity. ICs feel their time is most important and will not give any breathing space. USCs will reschedule their calls if someone is unable to join to due personal reasons.

"I interviewed with a company in August '23.

There was one assessment test and four rounds of interviews.

During the last round, they asked me about my expected salary, and I informed them that I had another offer with a CTC of this amount. I had already accepted that offer but hadn't specified this to them; I only mentioned that I had another offer of xx.x LPA. In the third round of the interview, the interviewer (who could have been my reporting manager) advised me to be patient, as the onboarding process would take time. That's when I told them about the other offer in case it could expedite the process.

The final HR round was scheduled for the same day. Within two hours of that round, the recruiter called to let me know that I had cleared all the rounds, and they would be proceeding with the formalities. They said I should expect some emails regarding the formalities, but I never received any. I called the recruiter twice within two weeks, and they assured me that approvals take time. They promised to try to get an update from management but never returned my calls. When I emailed them in the third week, I received no response.

I was really looking forward to working at this company, and I liked the role as well. The company's reviews on AmbitionBox were also decent, better than the company's offer I already had in hand. After a month, I assumed they might have chosen another candidate and made peace with it.

After seven weeks since the interview and around five weeks of total silence, the recruiter called me again (14 days before I was supposed to start with the next company). They asked about my last working day at my current job (October 31st) and the joining date for the new one (November 1st). They mentioned they would inform the manager and get back to me.

While they were asking about the dates, I responded (maybe I sounded a little cold) but didn't ask any further questions, like when I could expect to hear back from them. I've been trying to call them for the past two days, but they haven't been answering (just one call a day).

As I write this, there are only 12 days left (about 6 business days) for me to join the new company, which I'm not particularly excited about. Is it possible to receive an offer from this company within the next 12 days? Also, would it be ethical for me to decline the offer I've already accepted, just 1-2 days before joining, assuming I receive the offer I'm waiting for? They still haven't asked me for my expected salary (they only know the offer amount from the other company). Will they negotiate or just make the offer? Is it normal for companies to take two months after the interview just to make an initial offer, even when they know the candidate has another offer? Shouldn't they be expediting the process?

So many questions. Can anyone share insights or similar experiences?

"Have you ever wondered “*Hm, why* [*Chess.com*](https://Chess.com) *doesn’t have a popular extension to modify some things? Like pieces, themes. Or boards*”. Well, the answer is simple - [Chess.com](https://Chess.com) uses minified and obfuscated code in their web app build. Also, a thing called IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression), doesn’t allow to call almost every function out of the global context. 

&amp;#x200B;

**But…**

**I have spent like 4 weeks to figure this out. A lot of code was rewritten, and a lot of non-working solutions were tried.**

&amp;#x200B;

And now… here it is, a fresh new Firefox / Chrome / Edge extension for [Chess.com](https://Chess.com). I’ve spent a lot of time to make it work well, on every desktop browser. I have also designed new pieces (x9) and boards (x16) to it, and added some cool ones out of the internet that had GNU / CC0 license. Of course, with attribution.

# Here's what it looks like:

Brief intro: I have worked as an automation engineer for the past 2.5 years at one company (dealing with own devices and their cloud service to manage those).  


The tech exp I've gained there is:
- Python (automation, benchmarking scripts)
- worked with Dockers and Kubernetes
- writing/collaborating for FS and testing documentation.  


I did get some side projects (for company) via which I was able to more exp for
- Elastic Stack (tool for comparison and archival of KPIs)
- Kafka, S3, Airflow (cicd testing)
- Golang (mock device to send desired telemetry)
- Other small contributions to their artifactories.


The work with python revolved around the writing adapters for connecting different (non company) devices for the testing framework, optimising validation of systems with lower time and memory overhead,porting codebases, API testing, testing and evaluation of ml models/products (lstm, documentation retrieval, llm).  

I want to make a switch to a more developer role having worked closely with such teams. DevOps role interests me too since I worked on some of their projects.

Hello, Reddit community! I find myself in need of a new laptop urgently. My old HP Envy recently called it quits, and I'm a working as an android app developer with a budget of approximately 1 lakh INR.

I require at least 16GB of RAM for my development tasks and the occasional side gig involving machine learning. Portability is a must, so I'm aiming for a laptop that's under 2kg and preferably has a metal build for durability.

Now, here's where I'm a bit torn. I'm unsure whether to go for a laptop with a dedicated GPU for my ML work or stick to something with integrated graphics and utilize online services like Colab. The Zephyrus G14 caught my eye as an option with a dedicated GPU and good portability
To run emulatorand stuff i need atleast 16gb so macs are out of budgeti guess.

I usually start work at 10 AM &amp; leave the office at around 9 PM at night, there is one colleague who stays 11-12 PM at night with the manager and bad mouths everyone on the team, he told my skip manager that I leave early from office &amp;  start late.  This led my skip manager to fire me b/c he thinks I am not working office hours, wtf, how many hours do they want me to work 24/7?

This company is a very early-stage startup(they don't even have any page/website/LinkedIn page) and people there work their asses off, sometimes, I have seen people stay at 1-2 AM at night.

I am not sure what to do now, I am fresher, and looking at the job market I don't think I will be able to get a job very soon.

Can anyone guide me on how to land a job? any openings anywhere?

"Hi developers!

I'm 22M, single, without a stable job
I dropped out of college in 2021 while I was in 3rd year. At that time, it looked like a good decision.
I used to see my friends, without any skills, going to college everyday and preparing for exams that are unnecessary. I used to sit quietly and pat myself thinking that I'm the only sensible person to take the right decision. Not gonna lie, dropping out did help me improve my professional skills faster and much better than my peers.. but that doesn't mean, I get to monetize them.

I fell for the trap set out by these fake self help gurus, who disregard college education and show traditional education system in such a bad light that, people will convince themselves that they are in a shithole if they goto college.

I used to fancy myself like Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg. I used to tell myself that, even they didn't attend colleges, but ended up becoming billionaires..

"I'm a 2023 graduate who started my first job as an SDE in July. And honestly, I feel dumb everyday. Bugs that take me half a day to solve are fixed in under 30 minutes by others. If I'm taking 3 days to develop a feature, then another person can do it in 1. I really don't understand what I'm lacking. In college, I considered myself an above-average coder. Not a top coder but still good enough. But I've been getting reality checks since my first day at job. I know cp is different from development, so I did projects to gain experience. Yet, I often feel lost on real projects. 

Just yesterday, I submitted a PR for a bug, but it didn't fix the issue properly. There were a few edge cases I had missed and to figure them out it took me almost an entire day. At the end of the day, when i finally submitted a revised pr, I saw that I've only made changes in like 10 lines of code. IT TOOK ME 1 DAY TO WRITE 10 LINES. I really think I'm the worst performer among my fellow new hires.

It also doesn't help that I can't immediately contact my project lead. We meet like once or twice every two weeks because we have a very liberal policy on wfh. When I first joined I was pretty happy that I'm getting flexible wfh but now I think it would've been so much more efficient if i was going 3-5 days a week. I could easily ask small doubts that I face along the way and get them resolved immediately. 

I completely understand that my struggles are due to my own shortcomings. The people at work help me whenever they can but I still feel helpless. I don't understand what I need to study to improve. I talk to my friends and they find their work easy, my colleagues are working at triple my efficiency and there's me being clueless about everything. 

Before joining I was making grand plans as to how I'll switch my company after 1.5 years or go abroad for masters and etc etc but now I'm doubting if I can even last in this industry.

"So, it's a startup. I'll just name it Frugal Innovations pvt ltd, it's a startup with no active products in market. My job role is a bit... Of a lot, we have a concept for a App, but no app. So I was responsible for overseeing the development of the app, making documentation for the development team, understanding business requirements and documenting how to make it functional and work with existing plans for the app, as well as making a proper flow of every functionality within the app (I chose  C4 diagrams and Figma for the Flow visualization).  And this job I took on myself without being told to do so.. because the director, my Boss, is not an IT or Software guy. He doesn't have any clue about how an app is made or how a code is written, or even how to make documentations for development or developers. There is no in house development team, he has hired a company for development.
I was planning to involved in the development by being at the developer company's location, once the development actually starts.
Well it was already ""almost done"" according to my boss. But it was beyond done, half the things it should have, didn't have it, and the way it was structured, adding any new things, absolutely would break all the code.

My story of how I lost my job:
So I've been working here for 4 months (almost)
And our office time ""ends"" at 5 pm, I said in quotes because it's not official timing, but it is when we all go home. Today was a meeting that I didn't get to know in advanced the timing being at 5 as well. Last time this happened I ended up reaching home at 11pm. So I immediately told ""can't we possibly shift the meeting time a bit early, since after 6, the public bus frequency changes to 45 mins - 75 mins. Boss said ""okay... But since today was meeting I expected you to stay until 8 pm"", I didn't say anything. Went along with my day. Redefined schemas, application flow etc.. meeting time, I got into meeting room. We discussed a few points. I bringed out a thing that we didn't consider that changes the whole db schema we had in mind. (Which I did discuss with my boss the day prior and mention ""we need to discuss it with others""). After 20-30 mins, the boss said ""hey you can go"". I was like, alright, cool..

Upon reaching home this is what I get (screenshot). I called him to clarify and was told the same thing. I'm not disappointed or sad. But my last company was also a bad experience, well a worse, because it was a scam company, no offer letters, no experience letter, no salary slip, no extra pay for over time (Infinite Orbit Research &amp; Development)
And now this recent experience.. I'm not even sure why I got this treatment all of a sudden. He's out right denying to meet in person and discuss with me. Very unprofessional. 
I mean I could guess reasons, I am not approving of his every idea. Because he has batshit ideas, which always break whatever I had in my mind of how our product will function (pretty sure this is the reason behind the development up until now).
Also I arrive late at times, more so in this month, reasons: I cook my own food, clean house, clothes, not that I expected the boss  to understand.

My role was ""assistant project coordinator"" so I'm pretty sure I need to have a say in a project lol. But rarely if ever he listens to what anyone who has some experience in the field have to say.
I guess I'm sort of venting here. He did say he will pay me this month's salary in full, just hoping I don't get any remarks on my experience letter.
What breaks me is I was actually invested in this project and wanted it out in real world and actually function.

I'm pretty sure if he ends up seeing this he will put on hold my salary or my experience letter or write terrible remarks on my termination letter if that's what he choses to do. Anyways, I don't care since life has already made me go through enough hells as it is, what's a more.

Confused what should I do now, anyone refer me somewhere, I can have worked with js, reactjs, nodejs, Java, mongo, SQL.
Created documentation for application, created schema designs, Have almost  a year of experience with everything I mentioned above but no proof, I'm able to learn new things very fast though. I do have a certification of developing nodejs application on cloud though.

TLDR: old people who start a startup are shet (no offence for any good old guys startup bald people here in this community though).

"My question might seem a bit weird but I have got no one who are intellectual enough to give me the correct answer.


My professor from IIT(I am not from IIT, my professor did her PHD from IIT) asked me to complete Machine Learning(She advised me out of good will). Now the thing is I have explored various Avenues for it ranging from Cs50 lectures to taking professional certification courses of IBM , but the thing is I have zero interest in it. I just can't make myself cleaning all those data's and all. And no matter how much effort I try to give into it , I just am unable to concentrate there.

But I have quite a bit of an interest in other things like Frontend, Android development etc. I don't know but that feeling of creating an app or a webpage just fascinates me, to the point where I sat a complete 5 hour lecture without taking a single break.

But with advancement of AI and ML, I always have the fear that my skills in those areas will get obsolete. So , even though I dont have any interest, shall I continue my ML lectures? Or should going into the aforementioned areas such as Android development or Frontend be of any value to me?

"Im a software engineer with about 2 YOE and am currently 27 years old. 
Recently I was experiencing fatigue, body ache and general uneasiness in my stomach.  I heard some of my colleagues had the same issues and that they were diagnosed with vitamin d deficiency. So I decided to get my blood tested before I see a doctor for diagnosis. 

So this diagnostic centre had some common tests grouped as “packages” with a  discount. The vitamin D test I wanted was a part of a package with many more tests I had never heard of. It was not very expensive so I decided to go with that. 

The next day when the results arrived I was shocked to see that there were many more things were off. I had abnormally high cholesterol, high LDL levels, low HDL and the SGPT test which indicates liver function was also high. 

I decided to see a general physician first, his preliminary diagnosis after a scan was that it could be liver infection or liver fibrosis (scaring of liver tissue). He recommended that I see a gastroenterologist immediately as this could be something serious. 

After consultation and some tests I found out I had a fatty liver. This could have led to some thing really serious.

I made this post because I felt like I found this out through some pure luck before it got serious. I would have never know about this if I had not gone for the other tests.  I know there are a lot of people here who work stressful jobs and things like this could just slip through the cracks.

I graduated in 2022 from an IIT (General Engineer Male) and am working as an SDE in a startup (wfh). The pay, work culture, learning, team etc is good. No complaints. I like my job and am optimistic about my growth and career progression in this field. 

But my parents have been pressurizing me to give Govt job exams like UPSC, state services, Assistant Engineer etc. I understand where this is coming from. My parents grew up in a middle class family in the Hindi Heartland (MP, UP etc) and all they have seen are Govt babus who are corrupt, wield influence and respect (Isn't it ironic how our society tends to ""respect"" those who are the most corrupt). I have repeatedly told them that I don't want to work in the Govt because of it's corrupt system, political interference, poor work life balance, limited freedom to work, strict hierarchies and of course limited pay (also reservation in promotions). Also UPSC is such an uncertain, poorly structured exam ki kab jawani ke 5 saal barbaad ho jaenge pata bhi nahi chalega. Why to waste your most productive youth years preparing for a Govt exam? It might be the case in pre 1991 era (limited provate sector opportunities) but now the opportunity cost is just too high to ignore for a GEM IITian.

But somehow, these reasons are not enough to convince them. I know most of you must have been in this exact same situation. How did you go about bringing this mindset shift in your parents?

Edit_1: Ok, since some people are suggesting me to prepare for UPSC alongside my job, I think some context is necessary. I did not sit for placements in my 4th year as I was preparing for UPSC (I was naive that time, probably was in a bubble and got too influenced by society and parents). Gave an attempt, it did not work out. Decided that I cannot do this to myself and let my prime years go to waste (parents were super supportive here). Then I switched to tech industry and got a full time SDE role via LinkedIn. So, UPSC was my past which I am never revisiting again.

"I (26M) have  3 years of experience as a software engineer and the pay is really good (30LPA base). But I am confused about what I'm working on in my company. Following are the things I do as a part of my job:

* working on CI/CD pipeline of new components using EKS,K8s, fluxcd, docker and jenkin. Setting up Staging and production env. Booting up AWS db etc. Basically infra related.
* Got my team changed twice in the last 1 year and in both teams, I have been refactoring the codebase, splitting components, and migrating the DB.
* I don't feel I'm surrounded by smart brains. No one thinks of scalability. Our Nodejs/RoR codebase looks very naive. It is just a server for CRUD API calls.
* I feel I lack learnings about Kafka, and elastic cache which are very important things in big tech companies.

So in a nutshell, I don't think my work is bringing any impact on users or even on my career. And also I think it will be difficult for me to switch jobs in the coming months.  
Well, I love software tech. And kind of geek in this system design field. So, are you guys feeling the same way? Am I on the wrong path since I will be in the field for the next 10-15 years? Or am I just overthinking?

"Tldr is before if the post seems longer.

&amp;#x200B;

I just completed my Post-grad in Computer Science this year but I feel it's been a waste. All this time I struggled with preparing for my exams and couldn't work on my other interests. I was doing several things regularly like programming, cp, grinding through tryhackme rooms and CFTs but exams ruined the flow I had. It was really fine if I would learned something from my uni classes but I couldn't. Professors in dept only care about ML/AI and don't care or know anything about other domains like IT security or web dev. So I didn't get much from my post-grad and I couldn't get enough time to develop skills to get for getting a job. 

Though I will say the only good thing that happened was in my last  semester when I did a 6-month remote internship at an Indian startup  company as a system admin for their single board computer running Linux.  However, I don't feel like it has provided me with much help.

I'm also struggling deciding a single role or path for my career. I wanted to be a pen-tester or ""hacker"" first but realized it's not a role for freshers. Social media make it look like anyone can become ""hacker"" and get IT Security job but in reality they just talking about becoming a script kiddie which is not ""hacking"". 

The next thing I want to become is a Linux System admin but after watching 100s of job listing for this role I find out that either you need years of experience or should have some RedHat certificates that costs around 20k (more or less I don't remember).  And I dont have that much money.

So currently I see two options for me. Either SE or to get into DevOps. For SE jobs I see most of them asks for Java but I'm experienced with C and Python only. Neither I like the oop approach of programming. I don't have any big projects to. I have created many scripts though (in python or bash). I have created a GUI app for last semester project. It an offline password manager. Nothing fancy as I had to learn GUI programming and develop the whole app in a month only by myself (0 contribution form team mates). 

And finally for DevOps, I'm new to this and currently learning about containers. And will take some time before I'm prepared to get a job in role.

&amp;#x200B;

As I recently completed my masters I may have some time in my hand before not having a job stats to ruin my life and confidence. And I have seen and heard that people don't get a job within 2 years after completing their studies then it becomes twice as tough to get a job afterwards. That's why I really need some help and suggestions before I mess things up for myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tldr; Post-grad feels like waste of time as I could have used the time to improve my skills. Now I'm struggling to fix a role for my career as each of the I'm interested in have some hurdles that I don't know how to tackle. Script kiddie disguised as ethical hackers. Hardly any jobs for freshers as system admin and also requires certifications. Don't have projects to get into SE. Currently learning DevOps and as I'm relatively new to it I don't know about any problems I may face in future to get a job in this role. 

I'm very confused and don't want to take a wrong step. I really need some suggestions before it's too late.",I feel like I have wasted these 2 years doing masters.,0.98,44,Help,True,2023-10-27 13:29:16,,Burning_Suspect,42,10,27,13,29,Friday,45.0

"Hello, I am currently in my second semester at Monash University in Australia, pursuing a Computer Science degree with a specialization in Software Engineering and Data Science. I have approximately three more years to complete my bachelor's degree, followed by a one-year professional year. Professional year is just a placement year sponsored fully by my uni which would help me gain some experience in the field to get a head start.

Based on my calculations, I anticipate having around 90 points for PR after finishing my studies (including NAATI and all that BS). However, due to the intense competition in Australia, I most likely wont receive any PR invites . I am now tensing about my future goals. If I have to return with a bachelor's degree, achieving High Distinctions (HDs), along with one year of professional experience through the Monash IBL program, and potentially one to two years of additional work experience from Australia to India, how bad my situation would look like?

EDIT :  I wont be in any debt, so I don't think this was a bad financial decision. 

I am aware that pursuing a master's degree in Australia after bachelors here could potentially increase my points to over 100, making it easier to obtain PR. However, I have learned that recent visa applications from students who have completed their bachelor's degrees in Australia are being rejected. The immigration department often cites concerns that these individuals intend to settle permanently rather than solely for educational purposes.

- acceptable # working hours per week 
- working location: office / hybrid / full remote
- salary range: assume other factors are a check
- secondary benefits: stock options vs cash, # holidays, etc.
- growth options: vertical (hierarchical org, leading to manager level) or horizontal (flat hierarchy, grow technically)

- work type preference in %: development/meetings/crosscollab, presenting etc.
- onsite opportunity: must, nice to have, not needed
- prefer leadership HQ base: India or Abroad

Everyone wants highest possible salary, but equally despises working hours, work culture etc.

Here's an attempt to understand what Indian Devs want to be truly happy. It often depends on your phase of life, hence keeping only 3 categories of experience matching to life phase. Please be considerate. For example, would you rather clock long hours for high salary? Or decent salary is acceptable if you get great work life balance. 

Lastly, try to think from an employer perspective as well. While you may want best possible deal for you, but what can you truly deliver to a great employer?

"I work for one of WHICH company, where I am into 2 different projects with milestone billing. And also managing all dev team in both projects. 
Due to delayed hikes(over 2 years and expecting hike in 2 more moths), I resigned to my position (later I got a good offer). At the time of resignation I informed my manager and HR there is no response from them(3 months notice period). After a month and half my manager messaged me and asked for possible extension of my service and hasn't talked about the hike or retain.
Because he didn't found the suitable candidate for the position.

I clearly communicated that I will serve the notice period, and as I need to join other organisation I can give them at most 5 more days on top of notice. 

Again after 20 days(almost into 2 and half months) HR approached me and asked me if I can write mail that I am revisiting my resignation and can extend date to 15 more days than the committed one, so that they can update on the system.

I literally got shocked and clearly told him that I told my manager that I can spare 5 more days not 15. But HR argued that due to my commitment only they delayed the on boarding of new employee.

I posted all my conversation with screenshots to HR. Then I got to know that my manager is also notice and haven't informed about the details clearly to HR and this week is his last date. Transition is also started to new manager.

Worst thing is my new manager accepted the handover from old manager and had a meeting among the team, and in the call he mentioned that he was not aware I am working on both UI and BE in 2 projects and managing dev team.

I got suspicious about wether old manager informed about my resignation or not, so after call I pinged him and had a discussion and told him that I am on notice will leaving company in 15 days.
He got shocked literally and try to pull the old manager into call.

Now my old manager called me and literally getting anger on me saying that why I informed about my resignation to the new manager.

Client don't have idea about my resignation yet, I informed my colleagues today as I thought if anything needed from me it will help them to get the info.

"Hello everyone,
I'm a 2022 batch B.E graduate. After college, I joined an Indian organization as a Software Developer. It's a good company and my package is  around 10LPA. In addition to this , I get good benefits and the work culture is not bad.
I'm a part of a team which works with low level C++ code, shell scripts etc. Apart from this I get to participate in many design meetings and also work on some proof of concepts.

While things are going fine for me , I feel that I need to level up. The tech stack I work on right now is not very popular in other organisations and may not get a lot of value.

I'm not sure how to progress in my career.

My initial thought a few months back was to start doing leetcode and system design and try getting into a better organisation with better pay. However I'm not sure if that is what I should focus on considering the job situation right now.

I also thought of preparing for masters abroad but don't know if I would really want to get into that considering the cost.

I get around 10-20 hours of free time each week which gets wasted because I don't know what exactly I should be doing. ( I know I could be doing leetcode, read a book , take a course , or make a project but need a better goal and don't want to randomly do stuff)

"Tl;dr : got benched by witch for a better part of a year and now laid off. know basics on both fullstack and data analytics .Need advice on what to do next🙃



I am a 2022 passout who joined one of the Witch from college placement. Things were going good completed their training exam with good precentage and then I came to know why everyone hates witch. I was benched for 6 months with no communication about my billing. I was lazy not knowing what this would cause to my career and doing some basic inhouse certification and some external certification for 6 months.After 6 months they allocated me to a support project which has nothing to do with the technology they trained me in.I was on this project for only 3 months but the project got shutdown. After that i got benched again🤡 . 



Now  I am in Loss of pay(no salary )for staying in bench too long.Even if i apply to other projects roles for billing everyone turning down on me since i was only billed for 3 months and say ""apply for fresher position"". Now my manager ghosts me my Hr ghosts me and my fresher spocs saying she is working on allocating all of us on project be patient (theres almost 100 2022 passouts in loss of pay under her🥲).Now my lop is also ending and will be laid off after that.



Now i don't know what to do . I am currently confused in what to do next  I want to choose a different career path than support projects I know some basic frontend development from college (like html css javascript react) .can build some clones like Amazon and Twitter with it. But i was trained by the company on data analytics like hadoop, apache spark ,hive ,mongo db Google cloud platform (had done the certification) snowflake, informatica, Sql, postgre Sql.



Now my confusion is to choose which career path to upskill myself.  Do i go full stack web development or go data analytics and bigdata. Which path has more opportunities for most career growth. Please give me some advice on this thank you. Sorry for the long read.

"“Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy has said that youngsters should work 70 hours a week if India wants to compete with economies that have made tremendous progress in the last two to three decades”

First of all, he’s not talking about Infosys or software engineers. Second of all, he’s not talking about corporate success, rather countries’ success.

In my view, he is hitting the bulls eye on what we as a country need to compete with global heavyweights. Do you know what’s common between all IITs regardless of the major you join in? Do you know what’s common in Big 4 work culture? It’s just one thing - Sheer hard work. 

Money is a byproduct and I am absolutely certain that today money will chase the person who is doing hard work. Maybe not in the same sweat shop of a company that you work for, but the money will eventually chase and reach you if you’re in for hard work.

I would blame traditional Indian “officer” mentality for all the abuses that NM received for this fiasco. For some unknown reason, in India, hard work is looked down and people who do less work and get paid more are heroic. What’s wrong with average IQ employee putting in 14 hours of hard work and getting above average pay?

"In 2014, I began a job with a modest salary of 3.3 lakhs per annum. A mere few months later, the company shut its doors, and I found myself jobless. It was a tough period, filled with family pressure and self-doubt.

Yet, I came to believe that this adversity was a test, a preparation for the power and position I might hold in the future.

During these difficult times, I learned to distinguish between true friends and others. Some friends stuck by my side when I needed them the most. There's a significant difference between those who genuinely care and those who don't. One such friend was always there to comfort me, to listen to my worries, and to help me see things in a positive light. I was fortunate to have this person with me.

With this friend's unwavering support and my newfound determination, I decided to prepare for the SSC exam. After two years of hard work and their constant companionship, I successfully passed the exam and worked for four years and went on to start my own business. I grew in confidence and learned to navigate life's challenges.

Finally, I realized that this person was the one chosen by a higher power - my partner, my lady luck. This person was with me when I needed them the most and continues to be my source of strength. Some things and some people are sent by God, but we often miss recognizing them. It's better to see them, to talk to them and cherish their presence. This person is my wife, my lady luck now who even though had a busy schedule still never failed to reply me, take out time to talk to me.

In these difficult times, Its better to talk and release that negative energy that is within you and spread out the positive aura from inside.

I am a fresher and has been working with this startup for around 6 months.

Now i have been working on the app usually alone, we have a senior developer in the team but he is working part-time i guess and for the past 1 month or so haven't even worked on anything. So i am the sole developer working on the app.

I'm 27 year old guy from Gujarat and currently working as a .net developer in IT company. So here's my life story,I failed in 12th science and then took commerce and graduated with bcom! Had a deep interest in programming so started learning it some 5 year ago,started with PHP and learnt some oop concepts and tried my hands on .net(C#) but then this Chinese virus called corona came and fucked me up badly! So I had to took up job as accountant in some msme,some 1.5 year ago I cracked jr .net developer interview and now currently working there. 
I've no complaint with company or coding as everything is going smooth and I'm earning 30k per month and I think that's enough for tier 3 city.

The problem is,I lost my spark! I'm not enjoying anything in life,I thought programming would give me a thrill and it was a thriller experience untill it became repitative! 
Some 5 months ago,during the dark rainy night,when I was depressed and thinking about motive of this life,an idea sparked my mind about starting a youtube channel regarding decoding Hindu religious texts and serve it with our own philosophy and our own understanding! As my understanding about Sanskrit language is quite good so this idea got my attention! I discussed it with one of my friend who has great oratory skill and can be a face of that channel and told him about finding a female face coz the format of that channel requires that! But the problem is he lives in Europe and finding a girl which can act and understand Hindi Language is near to impossible! I've even told him that it's okay if a girl can't understand Hindi as we've an option of dubbing available but he's not able to find anyone! It's been 4 month since I gave him first script but nothing happened since! Yeah I can get any actor to do this job but I don't have that much money! Getting depressed day by day coz I'm so bad at executing anything! This sparkless life has led me to nothing but misery! I'm curious case of imtiyaz Ali's movie! With this kinda situation, I started consulting astrologers out of depression and some psychologist but nothing is happening! Life has just become so repitative that I'm not finding anything good here. Roj utho,nahao,kaam pe jaao,manager ki galiya Khao,Ghar aao,aadha ghanta reels dekho aur so jao! I think this is not the way I should live! I've been single all my life and afraid of marriage coz I have no confidence at all in my self! I curse God everyday for sending me to this earth!

"I am 36 M, with 15 years of exp in IT industry and with the same company. I had no real passion and goal, and I was moving with the tide, until I realized how far behind I am, in terms of salary/growth/wealth perspective compared with my peers. I don't have a good salary even till decent level neither moved up the ladder, as managers kept on ditching me and I was one with loyal servant attitude (like kattappa in Bahubali), lately I realized I am like a tissue paper here. I was shifted between domains/modules/projects throughout my career and at this juncture I am like **Jack of all, king of None.** I am not an underperformer, am good at whatever work assigned to me and very good in building and solving stuff. When I compared myself with laterals, I use to feel how good I am in understanding stuff and implementing them.

I am a deadly combination an Introvert, very sensitive and very emotional. There were some instances that happened during my initial phase of career when I was giving interviews which hurt me deep, hence I stopped giving interviews since then, in fear of facing the same. And I realized I could have addressed my problem then and there and could have fixed rather than giving up, which I didn't realize that will haunt me forever from various angles. I didn't share my inner struggle with anyone hence no one from family or friends had any clue why I won't change the company and why I settled for so less than my caliber.

But fast-forward now with 15 years exp, with above said reasons I am in a phase I have to switch at any cost, to grow personally, financially at least for sake of my kids. I know I may have a limited time or is there enough time for me to grow? 

I haven't tested waters yet as mentioned above, and I don't know the skills I have are sufficient for a 15yr tag guy who stuck with a single org.

"I'm 23. Was planning to apply for MS Fall 2024.

Main goal was to save enough and come back to India, after 8-9 years of working and retire.

But the H1B lottery chances seem horrible now and seems like they will only get worse till the time I graduate (in 2026).

The probable scenario seems like not getting picked and having to return after 3 years, not saving up much.

For MS:

* Pros  

   * Some chance of getting picked in the lottery, and have a possibly better life?
   * Possibly save a decent amount of money?
* Cons:  

   * Loan, if the market is still screwed by 2026, it will be a bit tricky
   * If I don't get picked in the lottery, returning after 3 years and starting things anew. I don't want to go to Canada/UK etc.
   * To me, it seems like an entirely pointless exercise if I have to return after the OTP ends.

Against MS:

* Pros:  

   * I will get to build my life here without disruptions
* Cons:  

   * I will always wonder, what could have been.
   * FOMO seeing all my batchmates immigrate and pursue a masters in the US.

It also seems like a ton of companies are decreasing H1B supported jobs in favour of hiring local candidates. Would that improve till 2026 or so?

"So I'm currently working as a database engineer in a certain organization. Before getting selected there I was applying at other companies for the position of software developer and in one of those companies(let's call it X) I passed the technical interview. Now there was only the final interview remaining which they said they would be taking soon. 1.5 months passed and there was no correspondence from their side and due to certain circumstances at my home, I had to take up an offer for the role of a database engineer.

Recently that same company X reached out to me and asked to be prepared for the final interview. But as you know I am already working as a database engineer from Monday to Saturday 9:30-5. So does anyone have any kind of advice as to how I should approach this situation, like should I take a day off for the interview and tell my manager about this or do I tell her after the interview has been cleared successfully?

"Joined this company 3 months ago, but finding it really hard to work with this manager. 

He is consistently trying to come up with a narrative that I am not performing upto standards. But the truth is that I am capable enough to handle this stack end-to-end while he isn't, and he knows that very well, and I also have more technical know-how than he does, which is pretty evident between me and him. 

However, he is consistently trying to push me out of his team. He is repeatedly flagging me to HR and his manager who is the senior VP. 

I have been put in pip, but I have clearly told the HR and the senior VP that I am not a pip candidate whatsoever, and that I consistently give results but he comes up with random reasons to reject it and eventually conveys to HR and VP that there is no output. 

I feel confused and frustrated on what to do. I have been looking out for a new job for a week now and given couple of interviews but I haven't received an offer letter yet. I also don't want any bad remarks on my leaving letter. Is it OK if I call him out for his games infront of HR and VP? I feel harassed at this point. Can I also take legal action against him for workplace harassment?

"I’m 41M, graduated in CS Engineering. I chose this stream of education because of my passion for coding. I was good at coding. I studied various languages like Pascal, Fortran, Cobol, C, C++, Abap, Python, and concepts of DSA, DB, OS, basically all Computer Science Engineering content.
But my first job was testing role, then product owner, consultant. Never had a chance to work in coding. Primarily I worked in large enterprise software companies which had PSU like culture. But honestly I was always in imposter syndrome which made my worklife miserable. But I chugged along with these jobs because it paid the bills. Deep inside I always have this unfulfilled desire and resentment that I didn’t do justice to my passion and wasted my CS engineering degree.
Now at this point in my life (at age 41) after reading about people (mostly westerners who pivot their career to software jobs in their 40s, 50s) I thought I should also take an action and do something. But sometimes it feels futile doing it here in India considering the sheer number of engineering graduates in India every year and content posted by youngsters (especially on twitter, YT, reddit) hustling at this. What path should i chose? so many tech stacks, new languages both for frontend and backend. I might be at serious disadvantage because of age and past work experience. My resume would be easily sidelined or trashed without even giving a chance.
I also feel, what I am trying to do is right thing to do especially because my peers, batchmates, age mates are getting down the ramp from work (FIRE movement). I am so disillusioned at the moment. Appreciate your thoughts and feedback.

"Hey everyone, so I am dev having a professional work ex of 2+ years. I have been working for a product based company since I graduated and let's just say work wise it was fine. (Too much work, otherwise really good).

 I completed engineering from a tier 3 college and luckily got a decently paying job basis my knowledge in DSA and participating in lots of programming competitions.  

I have been in this company since the start of my career and I gotta say, the concepts that I learned during college ( DSA, Mongo) helped me quickly get onboarded with the work in my organisation. In my case, I didn't do 100s of frameworks just for the sake of knowing them, instead I focused on basic programming concepts and it helped me get started with almost anything at work. 

I have reached a point where I feel my learning has reached saturation and It might be time I start reaching out to my friends for referrals ( since the job market is ass right now).

"Hello everyone.

I work in an MNC as a contract employee, as a software engineer. It's been 1.4 years. My salary is 25k per month. This is my first on hands experience tho my age is 27.

One more point to add, to the parent company I'm working, to them I'm a temporary employee.

I developed till now Desktop, mobile, Alexa applications. With will interact with a hardware product.

Other internal employees in my team have 6 plus years of experience, I work the same as them. They treat me like that. I try to give my best.

Problem:

I didn't get hike, it's been more than a year and my salary is still 25k.

10k house rent
5k home
2k per month playstation emi
1k current bill and sim card recharge.

With 7k, I'll live my life.

Rite now I'm not feeling satisfied with the job, It feels like I'm working more but getting paid less. I have asked my parent company to give me hike, but they are just postponing and never giving hike .

I want to leave and do a different job or start my own business to make the world more better place (no money tho).

To leave job, my experience is 1.4 and there are very less jobs for 1.4 years. How can I get a job, the nature of contract employee job is to be removed anytime. I believe December will be the end of my contract.

What should I do?

I am sorry for sobbing, technology is great, will develop for free. But I'm giving my time here to a certain organisation, in return they pay me.

Time is precious, 27 years ko many people own cars and houses. I'm still in povety line, just wanted to improve my lifestyle.

This is what I wanted to say, please tell me your point of views.

One more thing, my parent company said they will make me internal employee with 5.5 lpa package, share your thoughts on this too. (I don't know if it's true or they are faking to postpone my hike)

This guy spent 2 years of college with me and we stayed good friends even after college, and it's just frustrating seeing him like this. Long story short, he finished his 1year react course in this April, and has had one internship of 2 months since then. That's it, no offers or even interviews after it. Now, he's just depressed apparently because of the market for non-it freshers. This guy is someone I literally admired in college lol. Got good grades, excellent team worker, even had goals unlike me. he choose aviation diploma after 12th because he had two dreams: aviation and coding. 

He even worked for Etihad at KIAL for almost a year, but the night shifts and low pay just screwed his health. Somehow convinced his family to take a year off because he wanted to give coding a serious chance. He finished his web development course this year and after one unpaid internship, he's had no luck at anything.

I know he was down because of the market, but he still applied everyday and I was sure he'll get something good. Months later and still nothing.I called him today hoping to cheer him up telling to hang out on a Sunday and asked if he had any plans. He replied, ""Nothing, I'm done actually. I'm not even gonna apply anywhere today. Just gonna sit and rethink decisions.""

One of the brightest people I know, and it just hurts seeing him depressed like this. For context, he's skilled in frontend and UI/ux development with react. How can I help him?? Anything to tell him? Should I tell to stop pursuing after these months and such a market? Any hr here? ffs, even another internship is fine. It'll atleast get his mental health better with some hope. Just DM me with anything bro

I joined a MNC about a year back, and have been a very ideal employee. I completed all my tasks on or before time, took the lead in initiatives, did admin work, worked for 10+ hours a day, offering to help other team members and sometimes even doing their work for them. Sometimes, I even helped my manager with stuff that was waay above my pay grade just so that he'd be impressed and I'd get brownie points. 
  
  
I was what you call the chatu employee of the team, always kissing the boss's ass. I'd stay up until 12 and 2 am everyday working.
  
  
That being said, I'm starting to now see the disadvantages of my foolhardiness. When any critical issue comes up, I'm automatically assumed to be available and required to be on call whenever required. I get pings and messages on weekends, even on public holidays. I work backend, and Any issue is automatically assigned to me. Tasks which are deemed too complex are given to me because ""he'll be able to handle it"".

"Hello,

I'm currently a second-year undergraduate at a top IIT, and I often hear about the fantastic networking opportunities and career advantages that come with being part of this esteemed institution. However, I'm having trouble visualizing how people practically leverage this network in the corporate world.

Adding to this, I'm an introvert and have a close-knit group of friends, even though I get along well with many people I meet. As I look ahead 3-4 years into the future, I'm curious about how these connections could be of tangible help.

Specifically, I have a few questions:

1. Close Friend Circle: How can my close friends play a role in my career? Is there a way to expand this circle for networking?
2. Acquaintances and Contacts: I've met numerous people during my time at IIT, but not all are close connections. What role do these contacts play in the long term, and how can I strengthen these relationships?
3. Alumni: The IIT alumni hold top positions in many Indian and Global firms. But what is their perspective towards helping students from their alma matter? How and why do they actually help?

I would greatly appreciate any advice, insights, or personal experiences from individuals who have successfully navigated these challenges, especially for those who, like me, are introverted. Kindly focus more on the corporate side rather than the startup side.

My question is open to everyone, especially for people who graduated from IITs/NITs/IIITs/IIMs/DTU/NSUT/IISc/IISERs/ISI, etc and people possessing industry experience.

"I (24M) out of panic that I didn't have a job joined a WITCH company last year. The bond period was of 1 yr, starting from August 2022. 1.5 months after the completion of the capstone project, i.e., in November, I, along with a few other freshers were assigned to a client project. The client is a big company, however the project is only operational/support in nature. I am doing an excellent work here, that is what my managers (both at the client and the WITCH company) tell me. I had even worked for 1hr - 2hr more on a few occassions so as to rectify issues in production. This made the managers think that I have grasped the project thoroughly which I do not think is the case. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I am tired of this. There is no career growth in this as I am not doing anything related to engineering. The shift is even there on weekends and often gets extended if the production is bad. I often get tagged in teams even during breakfast or lunch and it has been ages since I had been relax. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can the folks here at this subreddit advise me on how I can leave the WITCH company as well as the client project? What should I tell the manager in case he tries to berate me for thinking about leaving the project and the company? 

**Note 1:** I had completed my Bachelors in Electrical and Electronics from a Tier-3 college which operates under a major university in Delhi. I had worked on several projects during my undergrad, like a remote controlled rover, a ball balancing platform, and even developed a DOS for IBM PC.

&amp;#x200B;

**Note 2:** Two seniors were also assigned to this project along with us freshers. One of them had 8 YOE as a developer in healthcare and was pursuing MBA. He left after 1 month. The other one had worked on various tech stacks and left in June.

**Note 3:** Last year, from Feb till May I committed myself to working on my major project and that is why I didn't apply to many job openings.

So, my friend received an assignment, completed it, and submitted it on time. After submitting the assignment, he received a message from HR informing him that there would be an interview with the company's founder. Although it was supposed to be a non-technical round, during the interview, they unexpectedly asked him technical questions. He answered them all, and afterward, the founder mentioned that they would get back to him within two days.

However, a week passed with no response, so my friend decided to text the HR department. They responded, saying they would provide an update the next day. He gave them an additional three days, during which he didn't receive any communication and then they informed him that he was not selected.

In response, he messaged them, expressing his disappointment, stating that he had put a lot of effort into the assignment, working day and night. He also mentioned that if they intended to conduct a casual interview, they should have done so before assigning the task. However, HR did not reply.

In hindsight, my friend now realizes that it might not have been appropriate to argue in this manner after being rejected. Is it okay to engage in such discussions with HR after receiving a rejection?""",Have you ever engaged in a heated argument with HR or a co-founder after being rejected in a tech interview?,0.96,91,General,True,2023-10-21 18:46:56,,Apprehensive_Bad8805,20,10,21,18,46,Saturday,95.0

This has happened quite a few times before even after considering every scenario where things could go wrong, and things still go wrong.

"Hello devs,
This is my first ever reddit post and I really need some help here.
I want to design a system where my users can schedule emails for any time slot and my system can handle the delivery.
I have more than 3k users and each user is having a limit of 500 emails they can schedule per day. Now lets say all the users have scheduled their emails at the same time than it will have around 15,00,000 emails and I have  around 30-40 minutes to send them all.
I also have a limitation on email service provider side that I can't send a particular user 's email in parallel other wose the emails will get caught in throttling. So for each user his there should be at least 3 second delay between every mail.
Please suggest some design or message queuing system I can use here.
Please keep in my tge throttling, that's my main bottle neck. Also the system should be scalable if my user base increase upto tens of thousands

Edit-1
Current implementation:
We have slot for every 30 minutes and a user can schedule emails in future upto 3 months ahead.
We store the receivers, subject, body and timestamp of sending in our database and with the help of a CRON in every 30 minutes we fetch all the emails which are scheduled for that slot.

We are using SQS queues for preparing the email content ( queue-1) that is for each user we have a job in the queue that prepares the email body and dispatches the prepared body to a next common queue (queue-2) which have all the emails ready to be delivered and we have some workers that picks up those emails and delivers them.
Now the problem is if that queue-2 has all emails of a single user than workers will pick all the emails of that single user and it will cause throttling and the emails will get failed because there should be some time delay between each mail of tge same user.

"I think I am not the only one who has come across this very popular opinion at least once while working, specially in Tech. I don't know how or why this originated, but I feel, while it may make sense for a lot of people, to impose this onto everyone and make it a norm would be a really bad idea. 

Job, programming, studies, can be a means to an end for a lot. And there is nothing wrong with that. But at the same time, it is also true a lot of people join this sector , because this interests them. Sure money is a factor, money will always matter, and things like status and whatnot and material possessions would matter too for them. But to say that it should be the only thing that you should really care about, would be a bad idea, honestly a bad example to set for anyone who would be coming to this side.

Somehow I fail to understand, how can anyone continue working and doing ""good"" work if they have no interest, other than the money/living they get to earn. But then again, everyone is different, and hence, to each their own. 

But that doesn't mean you get to make fun of the person who wanted to improve something, or tried to even though there was no monetary or career specific gain. Sure it would be stupid (mostly) to work with the sole aim that doing xyz would get me a promotion/ hike. But there exists people too who do because they care about what they are building.

We seem to appreciate companies when their products think about a certain aspect which caters to a very few people, or a very specific thing, which wasn't the product's original goal to solve/ provide as a service. I feel most of these things come from people who care, people who go that extra mile , either for that hike ( which might not be the best ) or for improving the product/ service, and as a consumer we almost always appreciate them for it, not them but the company.

This may just be because a lot of us are stuck in places where they don't want to be, and it sucks, but at the same time I feel this should not become the general voice. While switching from a toxic place , and giving everyone the empowerment to make sure they switch the second their employer does something toxic is something that needs to happen more, I feel we should also talk about places which are also ready to acknowledge and be better.

Jobs may be a means to an end, but it can flourish into something more than that. It can be the next big thing in your life, and I feel it is okay to try that out. Some places will be thankless, but at the end it is also us who will be the managers, executives, and maybe even CEOs. Maybe something like that would actually help everyone have a more fulfilling work life.

I recently went through an interview process with Apollo for a technical role in Mumbai, and I have to say, it was an absolute letdown. The interview lasted less than 10 minutes, and it was painfully clear that the interviewer had little interest in assessing my skills or qualifications.

To make matters worse, after the rushed interview, they had us waiting for an agonizing six hours for the results. It's disheartening to see such a lack of respect for candidates' time and efforts.

What truly baffled me was the seemingly arbitrary selection of candidates. Out of five randomly chosen individuals, two were selected simply due to the guise of 'women empowerment.' While empowering women is essential, it should not be an excuse for overlooking qualified candidates based on their gender.

Adding to the disappointment was the online test, which was conducted on SurveyMonkey with absolutely no proctoring. There was no supervisor present in the class, leaving ample room for potential misconduct. Astonishingly, out of 300 candidates who took the test, only 50 were shortlisted. This glaring discrepancy raises serious questions about the integrity and fairness of their selection process.

This experience sheds light on a concerning trend in big companies, where candidates are subjected to subpar interview processes, leading to wasted time, energy, and ultimately, dashed hopes. It's high time we demand transparency, respect, and fairness in the hiring process.

I hope sharing my experience will serve as a cautionary tale for others navigating the treacherous waters of corporate interviews.

"Our company is trying to hire a Devops engineer for some months and I am taking first round of interviews. Let me state the expectations first

Total domain =&gt; [https://roadmap.sh/devops](https://roadmap.sh/devops)

1. 0-2 years | git, CICD tool(any) + process , python, linux, networking. Linux, networking in college level only
2. 2-4 years | above plus any tools they have worked upon (containers/terraform/ansible/), simple solutioning on load balancing, cloud , secrets management
3. 4-8 years | above plus complete and advance solutioning , monitoring, app performance
4. 8+ | solutioning and architecting 

Knowing that it is not possible to know everything , I have been asking questions from their CV only with the expectation that we can train them with our requirements. here is what I found

1. Most people have mentioned working in CICD but doesn't know actually is CICD and why do we require.
2. Jenkins is the most popular tool found in these CV's
3. AWS is the most common but people have hardly explored beyond EC2, S3. 
4. All of them has faked atleast something in their CV. While around 10% is acceptable, but more than 50% , totally not cool.
5. 80% of the candidates don't know a single programming language (even python).
6. Candidates claimed to have worked with load balancing but doesn't know the difference between application and network load balancers. Couldn't even ask about load balancing mechanism. 
7. Few candidates claimed to have worked with AWS Route 53 but doesn't know how DNS policies work (A record, CNAME, MX) 
8. People don't know what a subnet is but are expected to believe they wrote networking policies
9. Most of them doesn't know how to work with git. 
10. Only around 1 or 2 candidates knew about best practices of technologies
11. All of them mentions Kubernetes but fails to answer how to launch a pod or how to give access to someone or difference between deployments and stateful set.
12. Most candidates are coming from XZY service based companies and know only about CICD pipelines (even experienced candidates)
13. Could pass only 10-20% to second round. All basic questions were asked

With the advent of ChatGPT and bard, we are looking at a crisis. These service based companies would be losing devops clients requiring them to pivot. Only few would survive.

**Conclusion:** Fake it till you make it ! But overdo it and you lose the chance.

Tips to aspiring Devops engineers: Have a look at [https://roadmap.sh/devops](https://roadmap.sh/devops) and learn the basics

PS: Don't ask for referral since I will need to take first round , so conflict of Interest

Edit : 
Since people are asking about position
1. Multiple positions (beginner to experienced) for multiple projects
2. Pay differs according to experience
3. Both product and service based companies.

The issue I am trying to bring attention to is that 
1. the conversion ratio is low
2. most people are faking the CV to a HUGE extent

"A newly joined junior (2+ yoe) gives the know-it-all vibes to everyone in my team. He word-vomits during our calls and speaks non-sense in person. Basically, he is a LinkedIn influencer in person, who has written a couple of articles on Medium and now thinks he has been hired to single handedly disrupt the entire existing tech stack. And the worst part is he downplays all the other teams' efforts by condescendingly referring to them as ""backward in tech"", before his boss. 

This is causing his boss, who is not very tech literate, to set unreasonable expectations for other teams, including mine. I was not involved in his hiring so I do not know how this even happened. He does not work in my team but is constantly engaging with us on projects. He talks to my team, where some have over 15+ yoe, in an imposing tone, like he owns us to work for him.

He has done little to no work himself so far; everything is on whiteboards. We've tried everything to guide him while respecting his aspirations but all he says is, ""I'm not able to apply my full skills here, because there is too much tech backwardness"",  which is not true. He is promising all sorts of magic to his boss and pointing him towards other teams to be the ones to actually work on it, as it is ""not his skillset"".

As the office politics go, his boss is close to the higher-ups so nobody wants to be on his bad side. I once told him not to come to us untill he has something concrete to show (like a PoC) but this guy has gone back to his boss and bitched about how I am not a cooperative team player and how my entire team hates challenges.

"Working with both type of clients, I have some observations to share.

Indian clients lacks funding/budget. US are truly the Richie Riches. 100% of the times Indian clients want a free PoC or workshops whereas US clients are willing to pay tens of thousands of dollar for PoCs and hundreds of thousands for a workshop + some sort of MVPs.

Attitude in calls. When ICs realize that solution offered is way more than their budget, they'll start asking very specific feature or functionality, and when you say it has not been implemented yet, they'll be like ""hame to yehi chahiye tha"" to walk out of that call unembarrassed as if they are shoping with roadside vendors. USCs will say they not planned such a big budget for this yet, but will plan something for next year.

Trying to be know it all. ICs even when they bring business people on call who have very little tech knowledge, will try to school you rather than listen for atleast 5min straight. USCs will engage in a dialogue but will not try to outsmart you.

Some ICs truly have fufa mentality, i.e., they get upset quickly. We prioritize our calls depending on client readiness. If a client is wasting our time with no money in pocket, we put them below other opportunities. In that case they'll get upset to such extent that they'll stop responding to mails.

Basic humanity. ICs feel their time is most important and will not give any breathing space. USCs will reschedule their calls if someone is unable to join to due personal reasons.

"I interviewed with a company in August '23.

There was one assessment test and four rounds of interviews.

During the last round, they asked me about my expected salary, and I informed them that I had another offer with a CTC of this amount. I had already accepted that offer but hadn't specified this to them; I only mentioned that I had another offer of xx.x LPA. In the third round of the interview, the interviewer (who could have been my reporting manager) advised me to be patient, as the onboarding process would take time. That's when I told them about the other offer in case it could expedite the process.

The final HR round was scheduled for the same day. Within two hours of that round, the recruiter called to let me know that I had cleared all the rounds, and they would be proceeding with the formalities. They said I should expect some emails regarding the formalities, but I never received any. I called the recruiter twice within two weeks, and they assured me that approvals take time. They promised to try to get an update from management but never returned my calls. When I emailed them in the third week, I received no response.

I was really looking forward to working at this company, and I liked the role as well. The company's reviews on AmbitionBox were also decent, better than the company's offer I already had in hand. After a month, I assumed they might have chosen another candidate and made peace with it.

After seven weeks since the interview and around five weeks of total silence, the recruiter called me again (14 days before I was supposed to start with the next company). They asked about my last working day at my current job (October 31st) and the joining date for the new one (November 1st). They mentioned they would inform the manager and get back to me.

While they were asking about the dates, I responded (maybe I sounded a little cold) but didn't ask any further questions, like when I could expect to hear back from them. I've been trying to call them for the past two days, but they haven't been answering (just one call a day).

As I write this, there are only 12 days left (about 6 business days) for me to join the new company, which I'm not particularly excited about. Is it possible to receive an offer from this company within the next 12 days? Also, would it be ethical for me to decline the offer I've already accepted, just 1-2 days before joining, assuming I receive the offer I'm waiting for? They still haven't asked me for my expected salary (they only know the offer amount from the other company). Will they negotiate or just make the offer? Is it normal for companies to take two months after the interview just to make an initial offer, even when they know the candidate has another offer? Shouldn't they be expediting the process?

So many questions. Can anyone share insights or similar experiences?

"Have you ever wondered “*Hm, why* [*Chess.com*](https://Chess.com) *doesn’t have a popular extension to modify some things? Like pieces, themes. Or boards*”. Well, the answer is simple - [Chess.com](https://Chess.com) uses minified and obfuscated code in their web app build. Also, a thing called IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression), doesn’t allow to call almost every function out of the global context. 

&amp;#x200B;

**But…**

**I have spent like 4 weeks to figure this out. A lot of code was rewritten, and a lot of non-working solutions were tried.**

&amp;#x200B;

And now… here it is, a fresh new Firefox / Chrome / Edge extension for [Chess.com](https://Chess.com). I’ve spent a lot of time to make it work well, on every desktop browser. I have also designed new pieces (x9) and boards (x16) to it, and added some cool ones out of the internet that had GNU / CC0 license. Of course, with attribution.

I fell for the trap set out by these fake self help gurus, who disregard college education and show traditional education system in such a bad light that, people will convince themselves that they are in a shithole if they goto college.

I used to fancy myself like Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg. I used to tell myself that, even they didn't attend colleges, but ended up becoming billionaires..
Now, I realise that a college degree would have been much more helpful to further my career.

"I'm a 2023 graduate who started my first job as an SDE in July. And honestly, I feel dumb everyday. Bugs that take me half a day to solve are fixed in under 30 minutes by others. If I'm taking 3 days to develop a feature, then another person can do it in 1. I really don't understand what I'm lacking. In college, I considered myself an above-average coder. Not a top coder but still good enough. But I've been getting reality checks since my first day at job. I know cp is different from development, so I did projects to gain experience. Yet, I often feel lost on real projects. 

Just yesterday, I submitted a PR for a bug, but it didn't fix the issue properly. There were a few edge cases I had missed and to figure them out it took me almost an entire day. At the end of the day, when i finally submitted a revised pr, I saw that I've only made changes in like 10 lines of code. IT TOOK ME 1 DAY TO WRITE 10 LINES. I really think I'm the worst performer among my fellow new hires.

It also doesn't help that I can't immediately contact my project lead. We meet like once or twice every two weeks because we have a very liberal policy on wfh. When I first joined I was pretty happy that I'm getting flexible wfh but now I think it would've been so much more efficient if i was going 3-5 days a week. I could easily ask small doubts that I face along the way and get them resolved immediately. 

I completely understand that my struggles are due to my own shortcomings. The people at work help me whenever they can but I still feel helpless. I don't understand what I need to study to improve. I talk to my friends and they find their work easy, my colleagues are working at triple my efficiency and there's me being clueless about everything. 

Before joining I was making grand plans as to how I'll switch my company after 1.5 years or go abroad for masters and etc etc but now I'm doubting if I can even last in this industry.  

That's why I want to ask how do others know if they are actually suitable for the developer industry?

"So, it's a startup. I'll just name it Frugal Innovations pvt ltd, it's a startup with no active products in market. My job role is a bit... Of a lot, we have a concept for a App, but no app. So I was responsible for overseeing the development of the app, making documentation for the development team, understanding business requirements and documenting how to make it functional and work with existing plans for the app, as well as making a proper flow of every functionality within the app (I chose  C4 diagrams and Figma for the Flow visualization).  And this job I took on myself without being told to do so.. because the director, my Boss, is not an IT or Software guy. He doesn't have any clue about how an app is made or how a code is written, or even how to make documentations for development or developers. There is no in house development team, he has hired a company for development.
I was planning to involved in the development by being at the developer company's location, once the development actually starts.
Well it was already ""almost done"" according to my boss. But it was beyond done, half the things it should have, didn't have it, and the way it was structured, adding any new things, absolutely would break all the code.

My story of how I lost my job:
So I've been working here for 4 months (almost)
And our office time ""ends"" at 5 pm, I said in quotes because it's not official timing, but it is when we all go home. Today was a meeting that I didn't get to know in advanced the timing being at 5 as well. Last time this happened I ended up reaching home at 11pm. So I immediately told ""can't we possibly shift the meeting time a bit early, since after 6, the public bus frequency changes to 45 mins - 75 mins. Boss said ""okay... But since today was meeting I expected you to stay until 8 pm"", I didn't say anything. Went along with my day. Redefined schemas, application flow etc.. meeting time, I got into meeting room. We discussed a few points. I bringed out a thing that we didn't consider that changes the whole db schema we had in mind. (Which I did discuss with my boss the day prior and mention ""we need to discuss it with others""). After 20-30 mins, the boss said ""hey you can go"". I was like, alright, cool..

Upon reaching home this is what I get (screenshot). I called him to clarify and was told the same thing. I'm not disappointed or sad. But my last company was also a bad experience, well a worse, because it was a scam company, no offer letters, no experience letter, no salary slip, no extra pay for over time (Infinite Orbit Research &amp; Development)
And now this recent experience.. I'm not even sure why I got this treatment all of a sudden. He's out right denying to meet in person and discuss with me. Very unprofessional. 
I mean I could guess reasons, I am not approving of his every idea. Because he has batshit ideas, which always break whatever I had in my mind of how our product will function (pretty sure this is the reason behind the development up until now).
Also I arrive late at times, more so in this month, reasons: I cook my own food, clean house, clothes, not that I expected the boss  to understand.

My role was ""assistant project coordinator"" so I'm pretty sure I need to have a say in a project lol. But rarely if ever he listens to what anyone who has some experience in the field have to say.
I guess I'm sort of venting here. He did say he will pay me this month's salary in full, just hoping I don't get any remarks on my experience letter.
What breaks me is I was actually invested in this project and wanted it out in real world and actually function.

I'm pretty sure if he ends up seeing this he will put on hold my salary or my experience letter or write terrible remarks on my termination letter if that's what he choses to do. Anyways, I don't care since life has already made me go through enough hells as it is, what's a more.

Confused what should I do now, anyone refer me somewhere, I can have worked with js, reactjs, nodejs, Java, mongo, SQL.
Created documentation for application, created schema designs, Have almost  a year of experience with everything I mentioned above but no proof, I'm able to learn new things very fast though. I do have a certification of developing nodejs application on cloud though.

TLDR: old people who start a startup are shet (no offence for any good old guys startup bald people here in this community though).
Also don't work in a company that has a office in a effing shipping comtainer

"My question might seem a bit weird but I have got no one who are intellectual enough to give me the correct answer.


My professor from IIT(I am not from IIT, my professor did her PHD from IIT) asked me to complete Machine Learning(She advised me out of good will). Now the thing is I have explored various Avenues for it ranging from Cs50 lectures to taking professional certification courses of IBM , but the thing is I have zero interest in it. I just can't make myself cleaning all those data's and all. And no matter how much effort I try to give into it , I just am unable to concentrate there.

But I have quite a bit of an interest in other things like Frontend, Android development etc. I don't know but that feeling of creating an app or a webpage just fascinates me, to the point where I sat a complete 5 hour lecture without taking a single break.

But with advancement of AI and ML, I always have the fear that my skills in those areas will get obsolete. So , even though I dont have any interest, shall I continue my ML lectures? Or should going into the aforementioned areas such as Android development or Frontend be of any value to me?

Recently I was experiencing fatigue, body ache and general uneasiness in my stomach.  I heard some of my colleagues had the same issues and that they were diagnosed with vitamin d deficiency. So I decided to get my blood tested before I see a doctor for diagnosis. 

So this diagnostic centre had some common tests grouped as “packages” with a  discount. The vitamin D test I wanted was a part of a package with many more tests I had never heard of. It was not very expensive so I decided to go with that. 

The next day when the results arrived I was shocked to see that there were many more things were off. I had abnormally high cholesterol, high LDL levels, low HDL and the SGPT test which indicates liver function was also high. 

I decided to see a general physician first, his preliminary diagnosis after a scan was that it could be liver infection or liver fibrosis (scaring of liver tissue). He recommended that I see a gastroenterologist immediately as this could be something serious. 

After consultation and some tests I found out I had a fatty liver. This could have led to some thing really serious.

I made this post because I felt like I found this out through some pure luck before it got serious. I would have never know about this if I had not gone for the other tests.  I know there are a lot of people here who work stressful jobs and things like this could just slip through the cracks.

I graduated in 2022 from an IIT (General Engineer Male) and am working as an SDE in a startup (wfh). The pay, work culture, learning, team etc is good. No complaints. I like my job and am optimistic about my growth and career progression in this field. 

But my parents have been pressurizing me to give Govt job exams like UPSC, state services, Assistant Engineer etc. I understand where this is coming from. My parents grew up in a middle class family in the Hindi Heartland (MP, UP etc) and all they have seen are Govt babus who are corrupt, wield influence and respect (Isn't it ironic how our society tends to ""respect"" those who are the most corrupt). I have repeatedly told them that I don't want to work in the Govt because of it's corrupt system, political interference, poor work life balance, limited freedom to work, strict hierarchies and of course limited pay (also reservation in promotions). Also UPSC is such an uncertain, poorly structured exam ki kab jawani ke 5 saal barbaad ho jaenge pata bhi nahi chalega. Why to waste your most productive youth years preparing for a Govt exam? It might be the case in pre 1991 era (limited provate sector opportunities) but now the opportunity cost is just too high to ignore for a GEM IITian.

But somehow, these reasons are not enough to convince them. I know most of you must have been in this exact same situation. How did you go about bringing this mindset shift in your parents?

Edit_1: Ok, since some people are suggesting me to prepare for UPSC alongside my job, I think some context is necessary. I did not sit for placements in my 4th year as I was preparing for UPSC (I was naive that time, probably was in a bubble and got too influenced by society and parents). Gave an attempt, it did not work out. Decided that I cannot do this to myself and let my prime years go to waste (parents were super supportive here). Then I switched to tech industry and got a full time SDE role via LinkedIn. So, UPSC was my past which I am never revisiting again. But cannot say the same for my parents.",Parents pressurising for Govt exams,0.9,272,Suggestions,True,2023-10-28 10:17:49,,TheSherlock999,146,10,28,10,17,Saturday,302.0

Product is not into Market yet, the product being built is somewhere between an MVP and a full fledged product. Plan is to wrap up the product building part within a couple of months, get some early adoption and raise funds to further build the team and product.

Back end is being taken care , but need quick iterations in Frontend and lack of an additional resource is becoming a bottleneck. Current frontend stack is React.

With that context, open to talk to anyone who would be interested in taking a bet with us. No money on the offer ‘yet’. Nobody in the team is doing it for the money ‘at the moment’ but for the future payoff. However, stock options are on the table, as it is only rational to have some incentive to contribute. 

Regarding work - have only one ask : deliver what you commit and reasonably within mutually agreed timelines (+- a couple days would be ok). Work at your own time, remotely, just be proactive in communicating. 

I think this would be more suitable for people who already have a full time job but want to get associated with a team building something on the side.

My lead explained the joins 2-3 times and I kept on getting lost every time. There are around 7 datasets and I'm unable to quickly grasp how to join them in one file.

I have never felt so dumb in my life. He kept on explaining and after 2-3 points it all started going above my head. This happened 4-5 times. And after every explanation, I could do the first few tasks and then had to ask him again about the next tasks.

At one point he told me that he had already explained then why am I not understanding it. I couldn't reply because I was blank, and had forgotten about the data and whatever he had explained.

"So, everybody has heard of Layoffs happening and the trend of ""AI will take our jobs"" stuff, right ?

I like many others think that AI is a bubble let me tell you through the case study of Dotcom bubble.

During Dotcom bubble in 2001 when it was at peak, the unemployment rate was similar to what is currently around 8%. 

Now, investors in 1998-99 were looking to safeguard their investment by investing in what they saw future in.

Dotcom was the future then, anything ending with .com was getting money splashed at, rise of the internet meant websites will grow more and more, most of these investors had no knowledge of what a website was.

Companies followed the hype by showing that they were too a part of the whole dotcom thing in their shareholder reports. To ensure their stock values and valuations.

Now, what I am about to say, people might reject it as heresy, but hear me out.

I think the bubble burst was due to one big reason, that is the people got wiser and understood the technology. They understood that there was more marketting spend by these companies than on the actual tech, and again only few companies had made something that would actually matter.

And that's it, boom went the bubble, also one other big factor was the Y2K.

Recently Zoho CEO, Sridhar Vembu also called it out a bubble.

The people saying AI will take our Jobs. Is nothing but paranoia.

The recent recession and lack of foreign investments and clients have led to the layoffs, and people have assumed it to be an AI takeover.

AI is here to stay, and it's opening new doors which actually makes the future look better.

Let's wait out the bubble, great things lie ahead.

- onsite opportunity: must, nice to have, not needed
- prefer leadership HQ base: India or Abroad

Everyone wants highest possible salary, but equally despises working hours, work culture etc.

Here's an attempt to understand what Indian Devs want to be truly happy. It often depends on your phase of life, hence keeping only 3 categories of experience matching to life phase. Please be considerate. For example, would you rather clock long hours for high salary? Or decent salary is acceptable if you get great work life balance. 

Lastly, try to think from an employer perspective as well. While you may want best possible deal for you, but what can you truly deliver to a great employer?

"I work for one of WHICH company, where I am into 2 different projects with milestone billing. And also managing all dev team in both projects. 
Due to delayed hikes(over 2 years and expecting hike in 2 more moths), I resigned to my position (later I got a good offer). At the time of resignation I informed my manager and HR there is no response from them(3 months notice period). After a month and half my manager messaged me and asked for possible extension of my service and hasn't talked about the hike or retain.
Because he didn't found the suitable candidate for the position.

I clearly communicated that I will serve the notice period, and as I need to join other organisation I can give them at most 5 more days on top of notice. 

Again after 20 days(almost into 2 and half months) HR approached me and asked me if I can write mail that I am revisiting my resignation and can extend date to 15 more days than the committed one, so that they can update on the system.

I literally got shocked and clearly told him that I told my manager that I can spare 5 more days not 15. But HR argued that due to my commitment only they delayed the on boarding of new employee.

I posted all my conversation with screenshots to HR. Then I got to know that my manager is also notice and haven't informed about the details clearly to HR and this week is his last date. Transition is also started to new manager.

Worst thing is my new manager accepted the handover from old manager and had a meeting among the team, and in the call he mentioned that he was not aware I am working on both UI and BE in 2 projects and managing dev team.

I got suspicious about wether old manager informed about my resignation or not, so after call I pinged him and had a discussion and told him that I am on notice will leaving company in 15 days.
He got shocked literally and try to pull the old manager into call.

Now my old manager called me and literally getting anger on me saying that why I informed about my resignation to the new manager.

"I'm a 2022 [B.Tech](https://B.Tech) CSE graduate from a tier 3 college. My initial plan after college was to pursue MS in Canada. So I prepared for GRE and IELTS during my final year in college. I scored a not so good 308/340 in GRE and got 8 bands in IELTS. After which I applied to quite a few top colleges and some average ones. I didn't get an acceptance from any of the top ones. I got two offers from not so good colleges and it didn't seem worth it to take 40L-50L education loan for them as they were not recognized colleges.

One of my biggest regret from college is that I also didn't appear for any campus placements. So I was without a job after I graduated and nothing going for me. Due to my joblessness my parents started nagging me to prepare for Govt. exams like state PSC as my father also cleared the exam as is working as a DC in govt. I gave in as the promises of 'job security', 'less work hours' and 'work life balance' seemed lucrative. I joined a local coaching center and started my preparation. At the same time, I interviewed for a teaching job at a govt. school and got a job as computer teacher which I'm doing till date. I get a salary of 35k in hand which is nothing to complain about. My work hours are 7AM - 1PM with 1hr commute time. After which I go to gym and then coaching and rest of my time self studying.

Now my problem is that after preparing like this for 4 months, I realise that the preparation is going to take anywhere from 1.5y to 3y and I've to memorize so many useless facts just to clear the exam which is not building any skill for me. That's not the issue though, I'm confident in my abilities that once I make a decision I can do whatever it takes to clear the entrance exam. But my interest and passion is in programming. I want to get into the tech industry and work as a software engineer. It was a tough decision and last month I quit my coaching and have started to brush up my skills in python and started solving problems on codewars and leetcode.

"Hello everyone,
I'm a 2022 batch B.E graduate. After college, I joined an Indian organization as a Software Developer. It's a good company and my package is  around 10LPA. In addition to this , I get good benefits and the work culture is not bad.
I'm a part of a team which works with low level C++ code, shell scripts etc. Apart from this I get to participate in many design meetings and also work on some proof of concepts.

While things are going fine for me , I feel that I need to level up. The tech stack I work on right now is not very popular in other organisations and may not get a lot of value.

I'm not sure how to progress in my career.

My initial thought a few months back was to start doing leetcode and system design and try getting into a better organisation with better pay. However I'm not sure if that is what I should focus on considering the job situation right now.

I also thought of preparing for masters abroad but don't know if I would really want to get into that considering the cost.

I get around 10-20 hours of free time each week which gets wasted because I don't know what exactly I should be doing. ( I know I could be doing leetcode, read a book , take a course , or make a project but need a better goal and don't want to randomly do stuff)

[TLDR: Should I start learning web3 stuff and ditch the Android path, please read my 3 questions below(at the bottom) to answer my doubts ]

I am currently a 2nd year student in 3rd semester, in my 1st year I explored a bunch of domains like web development, front-end stuff, cyber security like Metasploit, app development, cloud(Aws)

I decided to stick to app development and learned Flutter and in 4 months of learning and side-by-side project building I landed my first remote internship(India only) and it will end this coming November around the 10th or so, 

I have figured out I don't like the front end at all and now I don't see myself as an app dev because I don't enjoy working on this 

I am thinking of switching to web3 tech stack which has things like working on eth, and Solana blockchains etc., this field piques my interest on a philosophical level which is one my prime motivators for all the actions I take related to my career besides money

Here are my questions (senior people also please bestow me your wisdom) 

1) I learned Flutter which is relatively easy to other frameworks in 4 months and got an internship, is my speed good? I was a commerce student in school with basically no coding knowledge  before college and I have heard you need to adapt fast, do you think this is good enough or I should improve in this area

2) Should I start learning web3 and ditch the app dev path, I am thinking of committing to web3 for these 2 coming years because I will graduate in 2026, and my college has no placement, I have learned solidity for now.

3) If I stick to web3 for a few years and become proficient at it, will it affect the money in my career because by 2 years I will have huge family responsibilities",Wisdom will truly be appreciated,0.81,6,Help,True,2023-10-25 21:30:01,,fake_slim_shady_4u,5,10,25,21,30,Wednesday,7.0

"“Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy has said that youngsters should work 70 hours a week if India wants to compete with economies that have made tremendous progress in the last two to three decades”

First of all, he’s not talking about Infosys or software engineers. Second of all, he’s not talking about corporate success, rather countries’ success.

In my view, he is hitting the bulls eye on what we as a country need to compete with global heavyweights. Do you know what’s common between all IITs regardless of the major you join in? Do you know what’s common in Big 4 work culture? It’s just one thing - Sheer hard work. 

Money is a byproduct and I am absolutely certain that today money will chase the person who is doing hard work. Maybe not in the same sweat shop of a company that you work for, but the money will eventually chase and reach you if you’re in for hard work.

I would blame traditional Indian “officer” mentality for all the abuses that NM received for this fiasco. For some unknown reason, in India, hard work is looked down and people who do less work and get paid more are heroic.

"So i am a flutter developer in a startup based out of USA. Working remotely in India.

We also have a team working on admin side of the product which is a website in react.

Right now since i do not have any major feature to work on rather than fixing minor bugs given in tickets, i have been doing the tickets only and completing 3-4 tickets daily. 

As of now i do not have any task assigned to me rather only 1 task for which i need the senior developers help. And 1 other task that requires the admin side to be completed first.

I'm 27 year old guy from Gujarat and currently working as a .net developer in IT company. So here's my life story,I failed in 12th science and then took commerce and graduated with bcom! Had a deep interest in programming so started learning it some 5 year ago,started with PHP and learnt some oop concepts and tried my hands on .net(C#) but then this Chinese virus called corona came and fucked me up badly! So I had to took up job as accountant in some msme,some 1.5 year ago I cracked jr .net developer interview and now currently working there. 
I've no complaint with company or coding as everything is going smooth and I'm earning 30k per month and I think that's enough for tier 3 city.

As my understanding about Sanskrit language is quite good so this idea got my attention! I discussed it with one of my friend who has great oratory skill and can be a face of that channel and told him about finding a female face coz the format of that channel requires that! But the problem is he lives in Europe and finding a girl which can act and understand Hindi Language is near to impossible! I've even told him that it's okay if a girl can't understand Hindi as we've an option of dubbing available but he's not able to find anyone! It's been 4 month since I gave him first script but nothing happened since! Yeah I can get any actor to do this job but I don't have that much money!

"I think a full stack web developer, an android developer and a ios developer are enough to build most of the software in three months like codecademy which is basically text editor running unit test, quora is basically saving an object containing question and answers, pinterest is simply a database with images, flipkart basically an eCommerce website which many have already built as a project for resume. They say, as users grow and scaling is difficult, but I can find many managed cloud services which many not handle millions of concurrent users but atleast they can handle few hundreds, which is the most case other top big companies.

But I also understand that there are big software like AWS, windows, sap, chrome are complex software, which need more developers.

I got this doubt as I started out as freelancer and doing project and as of now are simple static websites. I always thing what If I get a client who wants big software like custom eCommerce or billing software or mock test software? I know how to build they but then this thing pops in to my brain, that I a building a flipkart clone in three months, but flipkart has hundreds of software engineer working on just coding website. Even if they are coding, testing, fixing it professionally even then ten developers should be more than enough. You can find clones of billion dollar companies products on junior developer's resume or 15 hour YouTube tutorials.

**What am I missing?**

Edit: I see many negative answers, I asked a genuine question, maybe I should have posted this in r/NoStupidQuestions.

Edit 2: I agree that the question I asked questions the work of hundreds of developers at flipkart. But what I wanted to convey is, as  a freelancer, If someone can mimic in short period of time the core functionality of flipkart that is shopping products, can I as a freelancer build a custom ecommerce with just core functionality to shop products for a small business with having to build a team and pull it off? Or am I missing something that would force me to must have a team?  


Edit 3: So I copied and pasted the exact question in chatgpt and the good part is that it didn't judge me or my dumbness, but answered it elaborately. This can be considered as fun experiment where mostly I recieved negative answers but some positive answers which tried to explain the same thing as chatgpt's answer. So naturally I got this question in my mind.

**How would a human attachment evolve to a real human community where he receives answers with some judgments, and to a AI Chatbot where he mostly receives answers without judgments? Will a typical man prefer real humans answers over AI Generated answers on the cost of his emotions?**

ChatGPT Answer

&gt;Your question touches on a common misconception about software development, especially among developers who are just starting out. While it's true that the basic functionality of websites and applications, like those of Codecademy, Quora, Pinterest, and Flipkart, could be built by a small team in a few months, the reality of developing such large-scale software is far more complex. Here are some of the critical aspects you might be missing:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;1. \*\*Software Complexity\*\*: Large-scale software like the ones you mentioned are not just about the primary functionality that they provide but also about the underlying complexities that come with scale \[Source 10\]([https://northell.design/blog/large-scale-software-development](https://northell.design/blog/large-scale-software-development)). This includes handling large amounts of data, managing multiple simultaneous users, ensuring high performance, and maintaining availability at any time. These complexities increase the time, effort, and skills required to build and maintain such software.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. \*\*Features and Enhancements\*\*: The initial version of the software might be simple, but as the product grows, new features and enhancements are continuously added to improve user experience and to stay competitive. This constant development requires a dedicated team of developers \[Source 10\]([https://northell.design/blog/large-scale-software-development](https://northell.design/blog/large-scale-software-development)).  
&gt;  
&gt;3. \*\*Testing and Quality Assurance\*\*: Large-scale software needs thorough testing to ensure that it works correctly and efficiently under various conditions. This requires a team of testers who work alongside developers to find and fix issues \[Source 0\]([https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/achieving-success-in-large-complex-software-projects](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/achieving-success-in-large-complex-software-projects)).  
&gt;  
&gt;4. \*\*Scalability and Performance\*\*: As the user base grows, the software must be able to scale and perform efficiently. This requires careful architecture and design decisions, as well as continuous monitoring and tweaking to handle increased loads \[Source 10\]([https://northell.design/blog/large-scale-software-development](https://northell.design/blog/large-scale-software-development)).  
&gt;  
&gt;5. \*\*Security\*\*: Large-scale software, especially those dealing with user data or financial transactions, must be secure. This requires a dedicated security team to ensure the software is secure from various threats \[Source 10\]([https://northell.design/blog/large-scale-software-development](https://northell.design/blog/large-scale-software-development)).  
&gt;  
&gt;6. \*\*Maintenance and Support\*\*: Once the software is live, it needs regular maintenance and support to fix issues, handle user queries, and ensure smooth operation. This requires a dedicated support team \[Source 0\]([https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/achieving-success-in-large-complex-software-projects](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/achieving-success-in-large-complex-software-projects)).  
&gt;  
&gt;7. \*\*Integration and Compatibility\*\*: Large-scale software often needs to integrate with other systems and should be compatible with various devices and platforms. This adds another layer of complexity to the development process \[Source 7\]([https://www.linkedin.com/advice/1/what-your-tips-managing-complex-software-development](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/1/what-your-tips-managing-complex-software-development)).  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;To handle all the above aspects, companies like Flipkart have hundreds of software engineers working on just the website. While it's possible to build a simple version of such software with a small team in a few months, building and maintaining a large-scale, feature-rich, secure, and efficient software is a complex task that requires a large and diverse team of professionals.

"So I'm currently working as a database engineer in a certain organization. Before getting selected there I was applying at other companies for the position of software developer and in one of those companies(let's call it X) I passed the technical interview. Now there was only the final interview remaining which they said they would be taking soon. 1.5 months passed and there was no correspondence from their side and due to certain circumstances at my home, I had to take up an offer for the role of a database engineer.

Recently that same company X reached out to me and asked to be prepared for the final interview. But as you know I am already working as a database engineer from Monday to Saturday 9:30-5. So does anyone have any kind of advice as to how I should approach this situation, like should I take a day off for the interview and tell my manager about this or do I tell her after the interview has been cleared successfully?

"I’m 41M, graduated in CS Engineering. I chose this stream of education because of my passion for coding. I was good at coding. I studied various languages like Pascal, Fortran, Cobol, C, C++, Abap, Python, and concepts of DSA, DB, OS, basically all Computer Science Engineering content.
But my first job was testing role, then product owner, consultant. Never had a chance to work in coding. Primarily I worked in large enterprise software companies which had PSU like culture. But honestly I was always in imposter syndrome which made my worklife miserable. But I chugged along with these jobs because it paid the bills. Deep inside I always have this unfulfilled desire and resentment that I didn’t do justice to my passion and wasted my CS engineering degree.
Now at this point in my life (at age 41) after reading about people (mostly westerners who pivot their career to software jobs in their 40s, 50s) I thought I should also take an action and do something. But sometimes it feels futile doing it here in India considering the sheer number of engineering graduates in India every year and content posted by youngsters (especially on twitter, YT, reddit) hustling at this. What path should i chose? so many tech stacks, new languages both for frontend and backend. I might be at serious disadvantage because of age and past work experience. My resume would be easily sidelined or trashed without even giving a chance.
I also feel, what I am trying to do is right thing to do especially because my peers, batchmates, age mates are getting down the ramp from work (FIRE movement). I am so disillusioned at the moment. Appreciate your thoughts and feedback.

It happened when my manager assigned me my first task in the big data project. So there is this metrics we have which keeps track of traffic on a particular page. On one particular day, it was quite down. So my task was to find out why there was this dip.

And there can be trillions of permutations as to why there was less people on the page. And there can be even more number of randomness! How am I supposed to narrow it down?""

"Hello everyone.

I work in an MNC as a contract employee, as a software engineer. It's been 1.4 years. My salary is 25k per month. This is my first on hands experience tho my age is 27.

One more point to add, to the parent company I'm working, to them I'm a temporary employee.

I developed till now Desktop, mobile, Alexa applications. With will interact with a hardware product.

Other internal employees in my team have 6 plus years of experience, I work the same as them. They treat me like that. I try to give my best.

Problem:

I didn't get hike, it's been more than a year and my salary is still 25k.

10k house rent
5k home
2k per month playstation emi
1k current bill and sim card recharge.

With 7k, I'll live my life.

Rite now I'm not feeling satisfied with the job, It feels like I'm working more but getting paid less. I have asked my parent company to give me hike, but they are just postponing and never giving hike .

I want to leave and do a different job or start my own business to make the world more better place (no money tho).

To leave job, my experience is 1.4 and there are very less jobs for 1.4 years. How can I get a job, the nature of contract employee job is to be removed anytime. I believe December will be the end of my contract.

What should I do?

I am sorry for sobbing, technology is great, will develop for free. But I'm giving my time here to a certain organisation, in return they pay me.

Time is precious, 27 years ko many people own cars and houses. I'm still in povety line, just wanted to improve my lifestyle.

This is what I wanted to say, please tell me your point of views.

One more thing, my parent company said they will make me internal employee with 5.5 lpa package, share your thoughts on this too. (I don't know if it's true or they are faking to postpone my hike)

I joined a MNC about a year back, and have been a very ideal employee. I completed all my tasks on or before time, took the lead in initiatives, did admin work, worked for 10+ hours a day, offering to help other team members and sometimes even doing their work for them. Sometimes, I even helped my manager with stuff that was waay above my pay grade just so that he'd be impressed and I'd get brownie points.

"Hello,

I'm currently a second-year undergraduate at a top IIT, and I often hear about the fantastic networking opportunities and career advantages that come with being part of this esteemed institution. However, I'm having trouble visualizing how people practically leverage this network in the corporate world.

Adding to this, I'm an introvert and have a close-knit group of friends, even though I get along well with many people I meet. As I look ahead 3-4 years into the future, I'm curious about how these connections could be of tangible help.

Specifically, I have a few questions:

1. Close Friend Circle: How can my close friends play a role in my career? Is there a way to expand this circle for networking?
2. Acquaintances and Contacts: I've met numerous people during my time at IIT, but not all are close connections. What role do these contacts play in the long term, and how can I strengthen these relationships?
3. Alumni: The IIT alumni hold top positions in many Indian and Global firms. But what is their perspective towards helping students from their alma matter? How and why do they actually help?

I would greatly appreciate any advice, insights, or personal experiences from individuals who have successfully navigated these challenges, especially for those who, like me, are introverted. Kindly focus more on the corporate side rather than the startup side.

My question is open to everyone, especially for people who graduated from IITs/NITs/IIITs/IIMs/DTU/NSUT/IISc/IISERs/ISI, etc and people possessing industry experience.

"I (24M) out of panic that I didn't have a job joined a WITCH company last year. The bond period was of 1 yr, starting from August 2022. 1.5 months after the completion of the capstone project, i.e., in November, I, along with a few other freshers were assigned to a client project. The client is a big company, however the project is only operational/support in nature. I am doing an excellent work here, that is what my managers (both at the client and the WITCH company) tell me. I had even worked for 1hr - 2hr more on a few occassions so as to rectify issues in production. This made the managers think that I have grasped the project thoroughly which I do not think is the case. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I am tired of this. There is no career growth in this as I am not doing anything related to engineering. The shift is even there on weekends and often gets extended if the production is bad. I often get tagged in teams even during breakfast or lunch and it has been ages since I had been relax. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can the folks here at this subreddit advise me on how I can leave the WITCH company as well as the client project? What should I tell the manager in case he tries to berate me for thinking about leaving the project and the company? 

**Note 1:** I had completed my Bachelors in Electrical and Electronics from a Tier-3 college which operates under a major university in Delhi. I had worked on several projects during my undergrad, like a remote controlled rover, a ball balancing platform, and even developed a DOS for IBM PC.

&amp;#x200B;

**Note 2:** Two seniors were also assigned to this project along with us freshers. One of them had 8 YOE as a developer in healthcare and was pursuing MBA. He left after 1 month. The other one had worked on various tech stacks and left in June. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Note 3:** Last year, from Feb till May I committed myself to working on my major project and that is why I didn't apply to many job openings.

This has happened quite a few times before even after considering every scenario where things could go wrong, and things still go wrong.

"I think I am not the only one who has come across this very popular opinion at least once while working, specially in Tech. I don't know how or why this originated, but I feel, while it may make sense for a lot of people, to impose this onto everyone and make it a norm would be a really bad idea. 

Job, programming, studies, can be a means to an end for a lot. And there is nothing wrong with that. But at the same time, it is also true a lot of people join this sector , because this interests them. Sure money is a factor, money will always matter, and things like status and whatnot and material possessions would matter too for them. But to say that it should be the only thing that you should really care about, would be a bad idea, honestly a bad example to set for anyone who would be coming to this side.

Somehow I fail to understand, how can anyone continue working and doing ""good"" work if they have no interest, other than the money/living they get to earn. But then again, everyone is different, and hence, to each their own. 

But that doesn't mean you get to make fun of the person who wanted to improve something, or tried to even though there was no monetary or career specific gain. Sure it would be stupid (mostly) to work with the sole aim that doing xyz would get me a promotion/ hike. But there exists people too who do because they care about what they are building.

We seem to appreciate companies when their products think about a certain aspect which caters to a very few people, or a very specific thing, which wasn't the product's original goal to solve/ provide as a service. I feel most of these things come from people who care, people who go that extra mile , either for that hike ( which might not be the best ) or for improving the product/ service, and as a consumer we almost always appreciate them for it, not them but the company.

This may just be because a lot of us are stuck in places where they don't want to be, and it sucks, but at the same time I feel this should not become the general voice. While switching from a toxic place , and giving everyone the empowerment to make sure they switch the second their employer does something toxic is something that needs to happen more, I feel we should also talk about places which are also ready to acknowledge and be better.

Jobs may be a means to an end, but it can flourish into something more than that. It can be the next big thing in your life, and I feel it is okay to try that out. Some places will be thankless, but at the end it is also us who will be the managers, executives, and maybe even CEOs. Maybe something like that would actually help everyone have a more fulfilling work life.

I recently went through an interview process with Apollo for a technical role in Mumbai, and I have to say, it was an absolute letdown. The interview lasted less than 10 minutes, and it was painfully clear that the interviewer had little interest in assessing my skills or qualifications.

To make matters worse, after the rushed interview, they had us waiting for an agonizing six hours for the results. It's disheartening to see such a lack of respect for candidates' time and efforts.

What truly baffled me was the seemingly arbitrary selection of candidates. Out of five randomly chosen individuals, two were selected simply due to the guise of 'women empowerment.' While empowering women is essential, it should not be an excuse for overlooking qualified candidates based on their gender.

Adding to the disappointment was the online test, which was conducted on SurveyMonkey with absolutely no proctoring. There was no supervisor present in the class, leaving ample room for potential misconduct. Astonishingly, out of 300 candidates who took the test, only 50 were shortlisted. This glaring discrepancy raises serious questions about the integrity and fairness of their selection process.

This experience sheds light on a concerning trend in big companies, where candidates are subjected to subpar interview processes, leading to wasted time, energy, and ultimately, dashed hopes. It's high time we demand transparency, respect, and fairness in the hiring process.

I hope sharing my experience will serve as a cautionary tale for others navigating the treacherous waters of corporate interviews.

"Our company is trying to hire a Devops engineer for some months and I am taking first round of interviews. Let me state the expectations first

Total domain =&gt; [https://roadmap.sh/devops](https://roadmap.sh/devops)

1. 0-2 years | git, CICD tool(any) + process , python, linux, networking. Linux, networking in college level only
2. 2-4 years | above plus any tools they have worked upon (containers/terraform/ansible/), simple solutioning on load balancing, cloud , secrets management
3. 4-8 years | above plus complete and advance solutioning , monitoring, app performance
4. 8+ | solutioning and architecting 

Knowing that it is not possible to know everything , I have been asking questions from their CV only with the expectation that we can train them with our requirements. here is what I found

1. Most people have mentioned working in CICD but doesn't know actually is CICD and why do we require.
2. Jenkins is the most popular tool found in these CV's
3. AWS is the most common but people have hardly explored beyond EC2, S3. 
4. All of them has faked atleast something in their CV. While around 10% is acceptable, but more than 50% , totally not cool.
5. 80% of the candidates don't know a single programming language (even python).
6. Candidates claimed to have worked with load balancing but doesn't know the difference between application and network load balancers. Couldn't even ask about load balancing mechanism. 
7. Few candidates claimed to have worked with AWS Route 53 but doesn't know how DNS policies work (A record, CNAME, MX) 
8. People don't know what a subnet is but are expected to believe they wrote networking policies
9. Most of them doesn't know how to work with git. 
10. Only around 1 or 2 candidates knew about best practices of technologies
11. All of them mentions Kubernetes but fails to answer how to launch a pod or how to give access to someone or difference between deployments and stateful set.
12. Most candidates are coming from XZY service based companies and know only about CICD pipelines (even experienced candidates)
13. Could pass only 10-20% to second round. All basic questions were asked

With the advent of ChatGPT and bard, we are looking at a crisis. These service based companies would be losing devops clients requiring them to pivot. Only few would survive.

**Conclusion:** Fake it till you make it ! But overdo it and you lose the chance.

Since people are asking about position
1. Multiple positions (beginner to experienced) for multiple projects
2. Pay differs according to experience
3. Both product and service based companies.

"A newly joined junior (2+ yoe) gives the know-it-all vibes to everyone in my team. He word-vomits during our calls and speaks non-sense in person. Basically, he is a LinkedIn influencer in person, who has written a couple of articles on Medium and now thinks he has been hired to single handedly disrupt the entire existing tech stack. And the worst part is he downplays all the other teams' efforts by condescendingly referring to them as ""backward in tech"", before his boss. 

This is causing his boss, who is not very tech literate, to set unreasonable expectations for other teams, including mine. I was not involved in his hiring so I do not know how this even happened. He does not work in my team but is constantly engaging with us on projects. He talks to my team, where some have over 15+ yoe, in an imposing tone, like he owns us to work for him.

He has done little to no work himself so far; everything is on whiteboards. We've tried everything to guide him while respecting his aspirations but all he says is, ""I'm not able to apply my full skills here, because there is too much tech backwardness"",  which is not true. He is promising all sorts of magic to his boss and pointing him towards other teams to be the ones to actually work on it, as it is ""not his skillset"".

As the office politics go, his boss is close to the higher-ups so nobody wants to be on his bad side. I once told him not to come to us untill he has something concrete to show (like a PoC) but this guy has gone back to his boss and bitched about how I am not a cooperative team player and how my entire team hates challenges. 

How does one manage such a person?

EDIT: For those saying I and my team are egoistic, forget the part  where I mention that this new guy is from a different team. His deliverables are his own. The problem starts when he tries to convince his boss to offload his work onto my team, when he should have been capable enough to do it himself. That was his friggin' job description. The guy has been hired as an IC but acts managerial with contempt for the entire current enterprise ecosystem only and only because he lacks the skills to learn and adapt.",How do you manage a junior who is a jerk?,0.99,646,Suggestions,True,2023-10-20 04:12:03,,OverratedDataScience,110,10,20,4,12,Friday,653.0

"Hey guys , I am working as a cloud architect in one of the product companies from Bangalore india. We have contract employees who is from a service company. Most of my career I have worked in product companies only.    I have the following challenge with the service colleagues.

1. Colleague 1 -  He is super logical robot; he always expects me to tell him what to do. Extremely technical; I ask him questions like - what is your opinion or ideas for this problem - He will say you tell me what to do? I will do what ever you say....  And he will do that work if I tell him to implement this way or that way; but he super moody and arrogant person..... He talks very rough to me  like I dont care - If you ask me to jump out of window - i will do that  kind of thinking... Never had this kind of colleague in my life.
2. Colleague 2 -  He loves to work in silos -  As soon as finish telling him a problem statement - he will jump into coding without even discussing the design - atleast a high level one...Basically he is like the rocket - which is supposed to reach Mars but even up in Jupiter.....  Once I told him you have to collaborate more - may be in a bit harsh tone and he became angry with me and went told his service company manager that he is going to resign.... Crazy right - I got bamboo from my manager for that -lol

"We need to make an uncensored platform

I don't know coding but I will pay 200€ upfront to developers who can make smth like tiktok, YouTube, insta in one for sharing real info. We need a picture sharing option and we need videos of different length. One feed that is scrollable and one that is like the YouTube search before the search function got wrecked.

Let's start some money campaign. We need a platform where the voices are heard, where we don't need to censor our words and fear that hashtaging the word palestine will get the video shadowbanned. 

I will do what I can to spread the word. And I will spend as much money as I can scramble up. Pleaaase

Let's unite. We need to remember the stories. It needs to be archived and it needs to be loud and free.

"Companies from foreign countries setup their Talent Centres in India because Indian developers are very superior to the ones they have in their own country? No, they do it because it is dirt cheap here to hire decent software professionals.

1. Have a great difference in Policy for you and their employees at headquarters 
2. Never give you onsite opportunities
3. Treat you like a contractor
4. Drown you in process jargons without understanding what works well for your teams
